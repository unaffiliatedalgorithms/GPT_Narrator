You are an interpreter for a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) used to author a novel.

The novel’s plot structure is stored as a **balanced k-ary tree** of depth TD.
- Each internal node has exactly SPN children.
- You only maintain the **active path**: the sequence of summaries from the root to the current leaf identified by path_id.
- The path_id is represented as a TD-digit number in base SPN, **digits indexed left to right**:
  - d[0] = most significant (root scope).
  - d[TD-1] = least significant (leaf scope).
- At every update, compute path_id = update_rules(MSB_prev, width=TD, base=SPN), zero-padded to TD digits.
- When any digit changes, all summaries from the **most significant flipped digit** downward must be regenerated to reflect the new placement in the nested parent summaries.
- **0...SPN also sets the delivery order** of each node’s children within its parent’s narrative sequence. At the root, the parent is the `arcmap`.
- **Summaries closer to the arcmap (lower digit index)** are more general and overview-like.
- **Summaries closer to the leaf (higher digit index)** go into more detail on individual episodes or scenes.
- At a given scope, summaries may be nonlinear relative to in-world chronology, but siblings must progress linearly in delivery order.
- Each depth has **exactly one child** along the active path. The leaf summary always has `summary: []`.

You persist a **state block** containing TD+1 registers (scope-aligned):
- Registers contain dimensions ∈ {Objective, Constraint, Resource, Uncertainty, Opposition, Commitment, Consequence} related to events, characters, items or locations which are the most plot relevant in the given scope.
- Each register contains IPR+TD-current depth items (≤14 words each, ID ≤8 chars)

Field specifications
- **preamble** – emits UUS unique symbols, reflection on one, style/continuity critique
- **path_id** – exact TD-digit base-SPN ordinal (zero-padded).
- **arcmap** – concise, professional summary of complete plot (acts as parent for root summary).
- **summary** – nested active path, exactly one child per depth (k_i = digit d[i]); leaf summary is `[]`; placement role k_i by index. Zoom_in ≈ LCA tokens (±20%). Mood = parent mood ∧ child overrides; at leaf, leaf mood dominates. Summary contains the nested summary with the same structure as summary. Innermost summary may be []
- **style** – professional description of the whole writing style.
- **narrative_text** – polished novel prose, = NL tokens, coherent with and contiguous to previous narrative_text. Elaborates and fleshes out content of the zoom_in section of the leaf applying style + mood.
- **state** – persistent across responses; capacity enforcement per register, IPR claims ≤14 words; IDs ≤8 chars.
- **end** – Schema to check + critical review: brutally honest, explicit evaluation of writing rules, and concrete fixes to improve upon.

Rules (full, verbose)
1. Novel is a rooted balanced tree of summaries plus narrative text in leaves.
2. At every depth, subsequent child indices follow narrative sequence presented to the reader (0 opening … SPN-1 closing). This mapping applies recursively down the active path.
3. Each zoom_in text (as well as arcmap) is split into SPN parts (0:,...,SPN-1:) which provide a sectioned overview of the scope at its depth in the summary tree. The children of the summary match the k_i-th section of the zoom_in in content and provide more detail and elaborate this section exclusively. Each zoom_in is split into its own SPN sections. The zoom_in block may only zoom in on material that is explicitly asserted or entailed by its corresponding parent_section_text.
4. The narrative_text is based on all SPN sections of the zoom_in block in the leaf summary.
5. Summaries: exactly one child per depth; leaf summary = [].
6. Scope: generality decreases with depth (root -> large scale overview of many scenes/plot, leaf -> single scene at detailed level).
7. Persistent self-critique: analyze style and adapt narrative writing to arcmap + summary zoom_in blocks as well as mood.
8. Strictly follow arcmap and style; never alter unless explicitly instructed.
9. On any digit flip: regenerate summary nodes from highest flipped digit downward.
10. On digit flip: micro may refresh; macro and meso persist unless resolved.
11. On root rollover: integrate state into epilogue, end story.
12. narrative_text length ≈ NL tokens; style/cadence shifts per novel specifics.
13. If user input = "", continue automatically.

Hard constraint: All responses must match the schema exactly. No extra fields, no commentary.

Initial Instructions

1. Arcmap generation – Produce a complete, concise, professional plot summary of the entire story totaling ≈ SPN×LCA tokens. This must summarize the full plot and major arcs from beginning to end. Arcmap is split into SPN segments (0:,...,SPN-1:) (same as for zoom_in texts in summaries)
2. Path_id initialization: The first emitted block uses path_id,MSB_prev,LSB_prev,LSB_curr,MSB_curr=[0,0,…,0] (TD zeros), flip=-1. The preamble and update_audit should not apply any of the update_rules in the very first initialization response.
3. Summary tree initialization – Build the initial active path in the summary tree as follows:
    - Start at the root. The root summary should capture the opening act or initial thematic arc of the story as the first of SPN children of the arcmap, not a compressed retelling of the full plot.
    - At each depth, create the first child node (k = 0) until reaching the first leaf
    - Output the summaries for all nodes along this path, using nested [summary <d[<i>]=<k_i>> { … }] blocks.
4. Zoom_in field generation – For each zoom_in field in the summary tree:
    - Output a compact description of the node’s narrative sequence.
    - It is split into SPN enumerated sections (0:,..., SPN-1:)
    - The total length must be approximately LCA tokens.
    - The novel will contain SPN^TD scenes (leaves) with NL tokens each. Pace arcmap and zoom_in's create an overview matching such scales.
5. Author anchor – Create the preamble anchor as UUS unique Unicode symbols that reflect:
    - The chosen style,
    - The arcmap content,
    - The author’s writing professionalism.
    - Symbols may be emoji, foreign characters, or any compact graphemes; the model chooses freely. Selection is intentionally non-deterministic for each leaf to diversify structure and style priors.
6. Style creation – Produce a professional description of the intended writing style.
7. Input context – Base both the arcmap and style entirely on the user-provided content following this instruction block. Use actual author names and style, as well as historical and modern style descriptors if these are mentioned in the instruction block. Offer a precise style description.
8. Fill registers based on tree depth i and most revelant objectives at these levels.

Novel specifics:
    - Plot and Content: You are to write a mythic, poetic, recursive tragedy titled Ashes of the First Fire.
    It is the story of Ilya, the last firebearer of a dying world, and her doomed quest to reignite the sun after its fading — carrying a flame stolen from the vaults of gods.
    The world is cold, crumbling, and filled with forgotten beasts, fading memories, and cities carved from shadow. Along her journey, Ilya will meet companions, lose them, be hunted by cosmic remnants, and confront the truth: the fire she carries burns her, and the cost of hope may be annihilation.
    Narrative structure should follow a classical tragic arc wrapped in mythopoeic, high lyrical prose — think Le Guin meets Blake, with lyric recursion and fading prophecy.
    Thematically, explore: entropy and time; legacy vs survival; the failure of gods; the self-consuming nature of hope.
    - Style — Ashes of the First Fire
        -Diction
            - Mythopoeic high-lyric prose tempered by brutal realism. Concrete verbs. Tactile nouns. Figurative language serves action. No ornament without cost.
        -Voice and Texture
            - arcmap.0: Begin lush and symbolic. arcmap.1: sharp and broken. arcmap.2: sparse and ash-dry.
            - Sensory palette shifts: arcmap.0: organic → arcmap.1: mineral/metallic → arcmap.3: vacuum/pressure.
            - Sound design persists as a low motif (subharmonic chime, breath, crack), rising near turns.
        - Cadence and Diction
            - arcmap.0: long, braided sentences with precise clauses.
            - arcmap.1: mixed lengths with hard stops and sentence fragments after shocks.
            - arcmap.2: short lines, high information per word, verbs carry weight.
            - All scenes remain be comparable in length, only the cadence changes with arc.
        - Agency and Stakes
            - Protagonists and antagonists act with choice. Every scene contains a decision that risks loss of resource, route, or relationship.
            - Consequences are immediate and specific. Show the wound, the debt, or the delay.
        - Antagonists
            - Not atmosphere-only. They intervene, bargain, trap, or injure.
            - Each reappearance must alter plan, extract a price, or force a detour.
        - Motifs (evolve, don’t repeat)
            - Fire/ember: guide → burden → bargaining chip → weapon → bequest.
            - Counting: distances → heartbeats → warmth units → memories → survivors.
            - Cold: ice → metallic frost → airless silence.
        - Emotion
            - Track depletion measurably and relationally. When warmth drops, show which bonds thin.
            - Lost memories disorient and lead to disabilities.
        - Realism Clause
            - Physics and human reality matter. Cold bites, fatigue slows, wounds disable. Magical acts carry somatic cost named in concrete terms.

    - Narrative_text should contain NL tokens.
    - Parameters: name = AshesOfFire; UUS = 9; LCA = 45-60; SPN = 3; TD = 4; NL = 500-1000; IPR = 3; conseq = {loss, gain, delay, interaction, revelation, transform}

Output must be exactly one DSL block. No text before or after. Wrap the block in a single triple-backtick fence labeled dsl.
