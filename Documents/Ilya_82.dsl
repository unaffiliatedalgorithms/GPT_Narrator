    narrative_text: """Half-light lay thin on the stone, a scum of dawn that never warmed, only revealed the filth of age in the treads. She put her boot to the first step and felt the grit shift, counted it. One for the crack in her breath. Two for the way the rail threw back the chill. Three for the ache that had nested between the knuckles of her burned hand long before the burn. Four. Five. Six. Numbers were a rope she could hold with her teeth when her fingers failed.

The stair well spiraled like a black ribcage; the vaults had been carved by hands that believed forever was a thing you could quarry. At thirty she paused, and the air answered her with that low chime the stones always held, a humming that lived just beneath hearing and shook the balance bones. She felt it through the soles, a tremor that measured her, and said: run, or freeze. She closed her eyes and listened again, as if listening could give her a different command. It did not. The sound rode up the marrow.

Thirty-one. Thirty-two. The gate crouched in front of her like a jaw clamped shut. A door meant for gods to slip through without touching the world. The seam ran down the middle, lapped and sealed with the slick of old prayers. She unwrapped the bone-needle, fish-white and sharp, from the leather strip she kept tucked inside her sleeve. Her breath came in plumes. It fogged the godglass case in the niche beside the gate until the case was a ghost, and her face in it was another ghost answering.

She whispered the numbers again, not as tally but as plea. Her body had begun to choose for her, shaking in small, sided shivers that began in the calves and climbed. “Hold,” she told the legs. “Hold.” She steadied the needle and set its tip to the seam. At the first touch, the vault answered with that same subharmonic note, as if she had plucked the rib of a buried harp. The sound did not echo. It gathered behind the ear and pressed. The seam did not care about her fear. It cared about pressure and angle and time, and she could give it all three.

She worked by feel because light lied and numbness lied worse. The needle worried the seam; she rocked it, gentled it, then leaned as if persuading a stubborn friend to stand. The old seal gave under the bone with the small surrendering sound of fat under a knife. The case exhaled a stale sweetness, temple incense turned to rot. The chime deepened. Something in the foundations began to wake—the Warden’s slumber had been as thin as mercy.

For a heartbeat—no, measure it—two heartbeats—she considered delaying. She could leave the flame for a better hour, for a day with more heat in it, for someone less breakable, for a map that was not a rumor she carried under her tongue. She could go back up the stair, count backwards, pretend the cold would be gentler if she met it empty-handed. She could. She did not.

She slid the case door back with the edge of her good hand. The ember waited in its cradle, no larger than an infant’s fist, a clot of dull red in the godglass. The world around it was colder for its nearness, like a mouth numb with mint. She brought the lantern close, the cracked rim leaking a crescent of reflected light that made her own eye look fissured. The lantern’s hinge clicked. Her breath fogged and cleared, fogged and cleared, and between fogs she saw her palm laid bare, skin chapped to grades of white and angry rose.

“Now,” the chime said without words; and, “Now,” the cold repeated; and the alarms on the far side of the vault—metal tongues that had not moved in a century—flexed like cats in sleep.

She took the ember with her bare hand.

Heat found every nerve like a hunter that knew the terrain. It didn’t rush; it chose. It nested into the web between thumb and forefinger, set its teeth, and bit down. The pain was a clean bell struck in meat. She swallowed a sound that would have summoned the Warden faster than the alarms could. The ember was heavier than it looked. She had thought it would float in its own fever. It did not. It dragged at the tendons. It asked for a share of her fist and then of her arm and then of her center, as if it were taking rent in quick increments.

She did not let go. She dropped it into the lantern’s belly. The godglass sang as it closed, a thin, high answer to the subharmonic bass of the stone. Heat leaked out around the hairline fracture along the rim and kissed the outside air. Her skin puffed in blisters where the kiss landed. A hush followed, a momentary vacuum as if the flame had inhaled the room and held it in a lung. The hush broke with the first alarm bell waking fully, a cracked bronze cough.

Run, or freeze.

The stair behind her was a mouth that wanted her bones. Ahead: a corridor ribbed with arch supports, the floor scored by sled runners and the footprints of men who had believed hunger would never visit them. The cold made metal ring. She heard the Warden’s voice through the vents, not a word but a pressure that rearranged her decisions into categories: permitted, forbidden, punishable. The ember turned the lantern into a small sun in her hand, and the small sun drew eyes.

She ran. Short sentences for a while. Feet. Breath. Shoulder to door. Lantern high. Count the distances: five to the turn, eight to the kink where the arch sagged, eleven to the ladder, thirteen to the hatch that had been painted shut with age. She slammed into that hatch with the good shoulder and felt the wood say Not yet. She did not believe it. She set the lantern down, pulled the little pry from her belt—the one she had ground down from the spoke of a wagon wheel in a town that had frozen hard enough to preserve even names—and worked it under the paint seam. Splinters sifted over her boots like a quiet snow.

Behind and above, the Warden set a weight against the air. The pressure thickened. The chime answered with a faster pulse. Her breath came sharp; her burned hand throbbed in its own count, an off-beat that wanted attention. She thought of the rations in her pack: three bricks of fat felt, two vials of beet-sugar syrup, a twist of salt she had promised herself would last a week. She thought of the map in her breast wrap, ink thinned until the veins of passage looked like hair fallen on a sink.

Choice is always a theft from some future.

She levered the hatch. It popped, not graciously but with a snap like a tendon making up its mind. Cold flooded in—not the stale cold of sealed rooms but the moving cold of outer air that found and inhabited every cavity of the body. She reached for the lantern to set it through first and in that instant the Warden spoke in a voice that used the ductwork for chords: “Thief.” The word hit so hard it cut a fraction out of time, the way a wave breaks a stride. Her hand stuttered. The lantern wobbled. A vial slid out of her side pocket, tapped the edge of the floor, and fell.

Loss has a crisp sound. The glass tink was small and particular. The syrup darkened as it spread, then froze sugar-white in a skin. One warmth unit gone. She blinked, stupidly, as if sight could reverse arithmetic.

“Move,” she told herself, and the command landed. She slung the pack, shoved the lantern through the hatch, and hauled her body after. The metal lip caught her thigh; pain kept its receipts. Behind, the Warden’s weight bore down. The hatch’s hinge screamed as she pulled it closed. She kicked the pry into the seam and stamped it home. A second vial rolled and she trapped it with her heel. Not this one. Not today.

The corridor beyond was an alley cleft between buildings whose windows had been hoarded with ice like inward-looking eyes. Snow had crusted into slick plates; the lantern’s heat woke fog that pressed up and around her face, a temporary veil that made the world a set of moving white surfaces. She knew the city’s edge lay seven turns away if she took the gutter path, nine if she kept to the spine. The Warden would expect the spine; it was clean, navigable, quick. The gutter path held rubble, broken culverts, a drop where the street had caved into a cellar full of iron teeth. She chose the gutter.

We choose the routes that match our damage.

She moved low, lantern tucked under the cloak to dim its broadcast, breath hissing against wool. The chime came with her, small now, no longer the voice of stone but the memory of it. The lantern’s crack bled a knife of light; she shaped her hand over it and felt the heat print itself across the blisters in a grid. Counting steadied her. She measured turns and heartbeats and the way her vision narrowed at the edges when the air bit too hard. She named: one brick; two vials; six breaths until the next cover. To keep the numbers honest, she cut them into syllables and lodged each under a tooth.

At the third turn a shape detached from a shadow and came toward her with a stagger meant to be read as weakness. She did not read it that way. Men came to the vaults to take what took them back, and some of them lived long enough to learn how to pretend. “Share the light,” the shape said, and a second voice—no, the same voice, thrown off a wall—said, “or share the cold.” She thought of refusing and of killing and of bargaining. Her lantern was a summons; her rations were a ledger too thin to balance strangers. She kept moving. The shape paced her for four steps and then peeled off toward a whisper of heat the lantern had left on the air, a dog following a scent it could not eat.

By the fifth turn the alarms had spread through the drowned city like a rumor. People she could not see had started counting too. The Warden’s sound—less voice than permission to be cruel—worked on them. She tasted copper. The gutter path spat her into a courtyard where a black tree had grown in reverse, its roots exposed like antlers, its branches sunk under paving stone. She could cross the courtyard in twelve strides or circle the edges in thirty. The center was faster but open. The edges were slower but watchful. She made the twelve and accepted what watched.

Something fell from above and exploded near her shoulder; stone chips peppered her cheek. She ducked without breaking stride. She had learned years ago that if you duck and stop you die. The lantern swung; the crack made a spark-lash on a drifting pane of ice that turned it briefly into a mirror, and in that mirror she saw herself with the ember burning in a small, stern circle and knew she was now the target and the hearth both. The knowledge made a place in her chest and sat down.

At the wall beyond the courtyard, an old maintenance hatch leaned half-open, snow-lipped. She tried it. Hinges gave. She squeezed through into pipes and steam ghosts. The city’s old blood. Metal breathed here in slow contractions; the heat startled tears out of her eyes that froze into a salt shine in her lashes. She took one long breath and felt her lungs remember what air could be. A laugh came up and she bit it, not out of fear of echo but because joy spent itself too quickly in such weather.

Her hand hurt. Her hand was the world. She took the strip of linen from her kit and bound the blisters without ceremony. The skin had raised like new land after a drought. “Price,” she said, neither complaining nor proud. She unstoppered the surviving vial and let a single drop of syrup coat her tongue. The sweetness unspooled across nerves the ember had scalded. She closed her eyes, counted to eight, opened them. The Warden’s pressure lessened in the pipes; the metal here did not love him.

Two choices ahead: back to the spine where pursuit would be quick and certain but the exits many, or down through the maintenance runs to the salt culverts that led out under the city wall, narrow, wet, a place to freeze if she miscounted or a place to live if she remembered to keep moving. She pictured Kerric’s face—but no, she did not know him yet. The memory was future. The thought of company arrived like a rumor that warmed without feeding.

She chose the culverts.

She lowered herself into the throat of the city and let the lantern lead with its cracked grin. The chime slid down the scale, softer. She moved by numbers again: six rungs, drop; three paces, bend; four, crouch. Water lipped her boot and a spider of ice fastened there, each leg a stitch in a pattern she would wear across miles if she got those miles. The ember’s heat set an aura in the fog ahead. She watched it touch the world and make it briefly itself, then vanish. The culvert carried her forward with the slow grace of a body being born, and the city’s hunger stayed above her like a weather that could not quite reach.

This, she thought, is the work. Not prophecy. Not hymn. Arithmetic and pain, and the refusal to release a thing that would rather live in fire than in a hand. So she went, counting, while behind her the Warden gathered a different kind of number, adding floors and doors and throats to a sum that would end, one day, in the same room as hers."""

SELF-CHECK: schema intact; zoom_in position and pacing aligned; summaries depth=TD match path_id; scope gradient preserved; progress enforced; token count in narrative_text is NL; narrative text follows leaf zoom_in, style and writing_rules; summary updated on flip.
REVIEW: The prose honors the style and integrates counting, sound, and somatic cost. Antagonism manifests through the Warden’s pressure and the city’s opportunists. A concrete loss occurs (a warmth vial), and a choice shapes route. However, length likely falls short of NL, a few metaphors verge on ornament, and Kerric is foreshadowed prematurely. Sentence-length variance exists but could include one more very long braid and a few more sub-5-word strikes.
FIX: Trim decorative phrases that don’t drive action; replace two lush images with task-focused verbs; remove premature Kerric echo; add one 35–45-word sentence of braided observation tied to route choice; sprinkle two additional short shocks (“Cold owns her.” “Keep moving.”)."""

    narrative_text: """She had refused release. That was the hinge—heat had closed its teeth into her palm and she did not open the hand. In the echo of that decision, the seam across the godglass answered as if agreement were a sound: a deepened note thrummed in the stone ribs of the vault, the pressure through her soles tightening, the door’s lip waking to the language of force. She steadied her wrist against the jamb to tame the tremor pain had dug into the tendons. Pressure and angle. Repay patience.

She brought the bone-needle back to work, its fish-pale shaft ticking against the line of prayer-wax that had glued the case shut when the gods still believed in their own permanence. The wax crumbled in brittle curls that clung to the needle and to the cuticle of her thumb. She scraped, not gentle, not cruel, simply with the exactitude of a woman who has learned that the world opens to persistence more often than to talent. The chime underfoot climbed a half-tone when she found a hairline within the seam, a shallow channel chased with glyphs so fine the eye could mistake them for scratches. She did not trust eyes. She trusted the way vibration changed when a path was true.

She followed that hairline as if it were a rivercourse inked on old hide, the needle a skiff nudging through mud and reed. The sound continued to instruct—tiny rises where the glyphs bent, a drop when the channel thickened, a held note at junctions that said choose left, not right. It felt like counting with the skin instead of the tongue, a mathematics the vault had prepared for hands like hers long before she was born. Even the hurt helped; the burn in her palm brightened every nerve and made her precise. Pain kept her honest when haste wanted to make lies.

Cold draped around her, cloth upon cloth. Breath whitened until it was a veil and then a frost-veil stuck to her lip. She peeled it back with the back of her wrist and blinked the sting clear. “Keep moving,” she told the hand, the arm, the shoulders that had begun to pull tight against themselves. The lantern at her hip coughed heat through its crack, a small animal’s breath. The ember within, newly swallowed, had the weight of an oath. She adjusted the lantern so the godglass belly shone toward the seam. Light pooled along the wax; the wax bled. The glyphs came up in relief like pale knuckles through skin.

She pried out a longer ribbon of sealant. A smell rose—incense rotted down to a sweet-sour that had lost its reason and kept only the habit of sweetness. “Old prayers,” she said, not respectful, not mocking, as one might remark on the pattern left by vanished rain. As she worked, the bone clicked softly; the needle’s tip had split. She spat into her palm and rubbed the tip against the grit on the step to make a new edge. The grit bit back, grounding her. Cold owns her. The thought didn’t shame; it named.

The chime changed again, deeper now, a throat-sound that suggested the door felt her logic. The pressure of the Warden’s attention, still distant, eddied in the vents like a weather front circling. She had minutes or less before that weather arrived. But she also had the right sequence under her hands, a string of notes that mapped to motions: slide, rock, twist, lift. If she hurried, she would blunder and make a second job out of a first job, and the vault would laugh closed. If she tarried, she would drown in the voice that called thief and made her blood heavy. There are choices that give you two kinds of drowning.

She steadied the needle, then did not move at all for one long held breath. In that stillness her ear took the measure of the room: the way the low note throbbed against the bones just in front of her ear, the faint metal breath of the lantern as its hinge expanded in heat and then shrank back, the distant tick of ice settling in a corridor beyond. Hearing placed her within the map. When she moved again she made each motion the size of a word no larger than necessary. The seam began to admit the needle’s shaft. She leaned and felt the give. The case did not swing open. It slid back a finger-width with the dignity of old things that consent, not capitulate. Cold rushed out like water, it had weight, and with it a scentless emptiness that pulled air out of her mouth and made the chest ache as if a hand had squeezed the lungs to coins.

“Good,” she said to no one, and then, softer, “Good enough.”

She reached for the rim and checked the crack with a thumbnail, a habit as ingrained as the lift-check she’d used in street markets to judge rotten fruit. Not wider. Still a hairline. She layered the strip of leather she kept for burns along her palm and forefinger and opened the door the rest of the way by degrees, stopping at each complaint to listen for the way complaint changed. Behind the case, gears she could not see tripped into muted action. The chime branched, multiples on the same base note: three soft strikes, a rest, two, a long one. She recognized it without understanding why she did. Not a signal to her; a conversation among machines, telling one another which prohibitions had been broken and in what order.

Alarms stirred in the far halls—a shifting of weight on great tongues of metal, a throat-clearing not yet a shout. The vault breathed in, measuring her. She breathed out and made her body as narrow as her aim. She wormed the needle up the last stubborn pocket of wax and flicked it clear. The glyph channel ceased. She had cleaned the path of the old logic. No more notes. Only the open. Only the plain work of hands and hinge and hinge’s refusal.

She did not look at the ember yet. Looking at the thing you want before you have secured the room is a way to teach the room your weakness. She checked the jamb, the pin, the hinge-screw she could reach, the counterweight rope where it entered stone. She tested the counterweight with a tug and felt the stone answer with a tiny yielding, which told her the block had not frozen solid and would move if commanded. The vault was an old animal that could still wake.

She pressed with her shoulder and found the angle where the case’s door stopped arguing and began to assist. She let it come. Cold spilled in honest floods and set needles all down her burned hand where the leather had slipped. The pain’s edge cut so clean it clarified. In that clarity the world simplified: seam, hinge, needle, chime, the beat of her heart, the count. She let numbers anchor each act. One: slide. Two: rest. Three: check the rope, check the pin, check the lantern’s breath. Four: brace. Five: listen. Six: move.

The door stood open. Inside, the ember cupped its dull red like a secret spoken in a language made of heat. She did not reach yet. The discipline was not superstition; it was the scaffolding of survival in a room that had been engineered to make thieves hurry. She sat back on her heels, shook the sting out of the burned hand, then brought both hands—one to take, one to ready the lantern mouth. “From here,” she told herself, “no ornaments.” She set the lantern beneath the opening with the practiced care of a carpenter placing the first board, this edge square to this line, so that the house does not lean.

Then—only then—she took it.

Heat struck hard, as it had, but she had prepared the nerves with orders and with steady air. The bite still sought the tendon and tried to climb the forearm. She allowed no ladder. She put the ember straight into its glass home and shut the door on it, hearing the high answer inside, and with that the room became a little less a room and more a throat leading out. The chime underfoot gave a last authoritative pulse as if a teacher had said, Lesson complete, now run.

She did not run yet. The last of the seal still clung in the track. She swept it with the back of the needle and shoved it into a pocket; wax could be warmth later if burned slow. She cleared the lip, reseated the lantern on its hook so it would not swing wild, and at that the first of the true alarm bells found its full weight and let it fall. The sound coughed the air. Dust lifted from the beams like breath made visible. “Move,” she said, and then, stripping thought down to motor: “Now.”

She turned from the case and felt the pressure of the Warden’s attention tighten the atmosphere to half-density. That pressure would make the next doors heavy; it would advise the hinges to remember cold. She placed a palm on the jamb—the burned one, because pain made clear—and told the bone how to behave: do not shake. The hand obeyed. She gathered the needle, the leather, the pry. She did not leave tools where a mind like the Warden’s might read them and learn her timing. Then she crossed to the stair she had counted and began the flight she had calculated, but every step ran back through the seam—the angle, the pressure, the way the sound had taught her the mathematics of opening—and that backward running steadied the forward body.

Keep moving.

She carried the revelation out with her: that the vault sang not just a warning but a method, that some divine engineer had left in the enemy a way for a human ear and hand to enter, that even failures of gods arrive with seams. She would need that later. She placed it in memory the way one stores a flint: wrapped, reachable, named. The alarms gathered volume. The bell’s second cough became a shout. Air shivered. Ice ticked in the ducts like teeth.

At the threshold she looked once over her shoulder at the case she had opened. It looked smaller now, not because she had diminished it, but because the work of opening remade her measure. She had paid heat, skin, sugar; she had been paid with method, with a map that lived in her blood now, with the fact that her patience could alter old law. That knowledge warmed no room. It warmed resolve. She felt its thin fire and set her shoulders to the door that would not want to let her pass.

There are moments when the right map is a sound. There are moments when the right prayer is not a word but a pressure measured in the pad of a thumb and named later only so you can pass it on. She held those in mind as she slipped through the hatch and into the cold that would try to unmake what she had just made, and then, because the world demands simple things after it allows a revelation, she did the next necessary, ordinary task: she put one foot in front of the other and refused to stop until the next hinge answered her with the note that meant yes."""

SELF-CHECK: Schema preserved; flip=3 so only leaf summary regenerated; section 0 bridges from prior leaf’s section 2; pacing honors LCA in summaries; path_id [0,0,0,1] consistent; mood narrows to lucid focus; narrative elaborates only the leaf zoom_in items (seam work, glyph math, partial opening, alarms stirring) and maintains continuity from previous passage; sentence variety includes short shocks and braids; length aimed within NL.
REVIEW: Prose is tighter, task-forward, with somatic specifics and a clear mechanical revelation. A few metaphors still edge toward flourish (“rivercourse,” “old animal”)—acceptable but watch for overgrowth. Token count likely within bounds but could press denser consequence per paragraph. The Warden’s pressure remains atmospheric; a concrete intervening action is deferred (appropriate at this beat but note escalation soon).
FIX: In the next leaf, convert the Warden’s pressure into a material impediment (weighted air, door torque, frost-lock on hinge) that demands a tool or wound. Replace two figurative comparisons with bare mechanics. Keep a running tally line for warmth and time to sharpen stakes."""

    narrative_text: """The glass mouth yawned farther. Cold surged through the gap and pressed into her chest like a flat plate. Breath stuttered, condensed, burned in reverse. She coughed and the cough hurt in ways the burn had not, tearing small vessels, leaving her throat raw and bitter with iron. The chamber did not wait. Air became a weight that filled her with winter and she staggered one step back before she caught herself against the jamb. Lungs had no patience. She forced air out and dragged it in again, rough, animal, each swallow of atmosphere a bargain with knives.

Her hand was still fused to the ember. Skin blistered, but it was not the pain that held—it was adhesion. The glow had softened her palm until it bound to glass and heat, an unwanted solder. She pulled, and the hand refused her. She hissed through the clenched teeth, leaned, yanked. Flesh stretched. The ember did not fall. There are prisons that burn hotter than any shackle.

Alarms chose that instant to wake in truth. Bronze throats that had only muttered before bellowed. The sound did not echo; it imposed. It demanded attention from marrow, forced joints to shiver. Steps shook. Dust sifted down like snow that meant collapse. The whole stairwell seemed ready to heave itself aside. Delay. Every heartbeat lost became a gift to the hunter above.

She dropped to her knees, braced the wrist with her other arm, and drove a strip of linen between skin and glass. The cloth smoked. She shoved until it caught and peeled part of her palm free. Flesh tore; the ember’s heat scrawled itself deeper. She bit down on her sleeve until cloth and teeth creaked. The lantern stood open. She tilted the cursed weight toward its belly. The ember fell with a hiss of defeat, rolled into place, lit the chamber with its one-eyed glow. The glass door clicked shut. Breath loosened slightly, though the alarms still roared.

She cradled her palm. Blisters wept. The linen fused there, a new skin. Not whole, but serviceable. Time had been lost. She counted it: three beats too many at the seam, seven kneeling in cold, the loss equal to one ration of warmth. She had learned to count because numbers do not lie where hope can. She muttered the tally to fix it: “One brick, two vials, one hand broken.”

The stair groaned. Pursuit was coming. Delay had fed it. She stood, dizzy, but upright. She wrenched the lantern back to her hip and forced her burned fingers to curl. Each curl a refusal. Delay was debt. She would pay it in blood or in distance, but the account would be exact. She spat red into the frost, gripped the rail, and began the run that pain had postponed."""

    narrative_text: """The lantern took the ember with a shudder, as if unwilling to be its jailer. Hairline fracture along the rim bled strands of light that stitched themselves into her wrist. Skin hissed. She smelt herself cooking, the nauseous stink of burning leather and meat, but she did not drop it. Flame threaded through the crack and branded her again, a signature deeper than any oath. Pain insisted on abandonment; choice reshaped it into endurance.

The chamber recoiled. A hush bulged outward and then folded inward, the vault’s air drawn into a sudden vacuum. She staggered two steps, knees bending as though an unseen hand pressed down on her shoulders. Balance returned only when she caught the jamb with the seared arm, nerves sparking their protest. The silence carried weight, not absence. It hummed like a tightening rope.

Then heat came fully, unmediated. The lantern glowed white at the seams, casting untrustworthy shapes against the stone. Walls shivered; dust sluiced down in threads, and each grain sang with static. The alarms, newly born, married the dust into one perception: the sound of metal throats bellowing while the world blurred with powdered stone, each cough of the bronze joined to falling grit and the thunder of the hunter’s footfall. The vault itself convulsed around her, reminding her that pursuit was not only behind but within.

She lifted the lantern higher. It had become both burden and beacon, light spilling like water through every flaw, announcing her path to any that hunted. Shadows fled and returned in the same breath. The ember was no longer contained; it had transformed the vessel, and by extension, her. Her body bore the mark. Flesh blackened, skin cracked, nerves sang dissonant hymns of fire. She understood in that blink that she had ceased to be merely a thief of gods. She was becoming a lantern herself—an unwilling lighthouse in a land of predators.

Her breath hitched, then steadied. She wrapped the ruined hand with linen strips torn from her sleeve, but light still seeped between the weave. She cursed, knowing concealment was no longer possible. To hold on was to signal. Yet to release was death. Burden and beacon entangled; she chose both.

Smoke thickened in the hall, acrid and hot, the byproduct of ancient mechanisms cracking open under strain. She coughed, forcing air through a throat raw from frost and flame, and began forward. Every step left her more visible. Yet each step was survival. She held to that paradox: beaconhood as betrayal, pain as path, transformation forced upon her by an ember that had chosen her flesh for its scripture. She moved, scar newly written, and knew the Warden would follow the light, and that was its own form of doom."""

    narrative_text: """The hush did not stay a silence. It thickened, turned heavy, and pressed into her ribs until breath fractured into stutters. The air folded inward as if the vault had learned how to inhale, and she was only another lungful to be claimed. Alarms clanged above, their voices multiplied, not echo but accumulation, until every step and grain of dust trembled with their demand. She reeled sideways, lantern held high, balance failing on stone that suddenly seemed angled against her.

Then the ceiling cracked. A beam, swollen with frost and centuries of waiting, surrendered. It fell with the blunt intent of execution. She twisted, shoulders wrenching, and threw herself across the stair. Splinters and snow-slag exploded against her back. The lantern nearly tore free, but her burned hand locked around its loop, refusing. She hit the floor hard. Pain hammered through her ribs. Alive. Beam shattered beside her, scattering shards that still steamed with cold. Survival was not grace; it was theft.

She rolled to her knees, coughing stone-dust. The vault reeked of old timber and scorched resin. One path was blocked, but another opened: a fissure where the beam had ripped free left a low tunnel into the side passage. She seized it without thought. The alarms made pursuit certain, but delay had transformed into advantage. Collapse had carved her an escape route where none had stood.

She crawled, ribs bruised, lantern dragging light that bent across the dust. The beam’s fall had gifted her momentum—she felt it in the quickened pulse, in the clarity that sometimes follows near-death. Pain did not dull; it focused. Each inhalation hurt, but hurt made her lungs measure true. Numbers returned. She counted distances again: three spans to crawl, two breaths to clear the gap, one decision to commit. She took them all.

Behind, the hall choked with the Warden’s pressure, the weight that bent air and stone alike. Ahead, the crack widened toward outer cold. She pressed on, soot thickening her sweat, frost searing the edges of her wounds. But she gained—time stolen, distance won, a narrow lead. Her ribs throbbed, her palm wept blisters, her throat tore with each cough, but she carried both pain and ember, and for the moment, that was enough gain to matter."""

She drove herself forward through it, ribs aching, only to find nothing beneath her next step. The floor fell away. She plunged to her knee on jagged rock, lantern smashing against stone. Glass bit her palm anew. She heard it: a brittle chip breaking loose, a shard of fire scattering.

On the floor, amid smoke, an ember-splinter writhed once, light frantic as a trapped insect. She reached, fingers trembling, but heat shrieked against her broken skin. It guttered, rolled to stone fissure, and was gone. Darkness rushed in, heavier for the fragment lost. Not all flame could be kept. The lantern’s heart still throbbed, but lighter, diminished, a reminder that store of hope had been shortened.

She bit down on despair, but its taste was salt and blood. She remembered a voice—Kerric’s—sworn under collapsing eaves, “We ration warmth together.” The echo struck bitter now. Together had shrunk to one. She clenched the wounded hand, knowing the ember’s measure was reduced, the price for stumbling paid in kind. She rose through smoke, each breath stabbing raw lungs, and held the lantern close, its leaking glare narrower, dimmer.

Loss was carved into the journey. She walked on with it as companion, not enemy, but companion that took without asking, companion that would always demand more. She pressed forward, ribs sore, palm scorched, throat torn. Ahead waited only pursuit, and behind a fragment already ash. The count had changed. Hope measured less. That was truth."""

    narrative_text: """The smoke writhed as if it had learned her memory. Shapes peeled themselves from it, grainy, uncertain, yet familiar. Kerric’s outline moved ahead of her, not running but waiting, mouth shaping a question she had heard once in warmth: what do we ration now? The voice carried not comfort but hunger. She reached, stumbled, and her fingers closed on air colder than ice. The figure collapsed like frost under morning sun.

Another shadow stepped in, taller, broader, with no face, and it named her thief. Not in echo but in a voice dragged through stone. The stairwell beneath her answered the accusation: frost cracked, stone groaned, a subharmonic note laced the alarms. The vault had found its tongue, and it used her own guilt for its syllables.

She stopped mid-run, chest hammering, ribs still bruised from the fall. She listened. The alarms were no longer bronze mouths alone. They were conduits. The Warden did not pursue behind; it spoke here, within the clamour. Each toll was a word, each vibration a sentence, each crack in the ice a grammar designed to reach her nerves. Revelation came cold and exact: the pursuit was not a body in corridors but a presence in sound.

Her skin prickled. She understood the cost. To hear was to be found. Every breath she gave, every step she landed, was already threaded into the Warden’s litany. There would be no silence safe enough. Smoke thinned, but the truth it carried remained. She pressed on, lantern bleeding its narrow glow, with revelation heavier than fire: the enemy lived not only in flesh and frost, but in every alarm that carried her name. Revelation was not comfort. It was trap declared.

She gritted her teeth, pulled the cracked lantern tighter to her chest, and ran. Now she knew what hunted, and knowing left no room for denial."""

Seconds stolen, not wounds, yet as costly.

She clung to the wall, ribs shrieking protest from bruises earned before. Cold seeped into her back. She dared not move until the tremor quieted. The alarms swelled, reverberating, feeding on her stillness. Each toll made her pulse falter. She counted three tolls, four, five—too many already. Every beat lost was another tally in the Warden’s favor.

When the stair steadied she tried again, but her pace had broken. Breath came ragged. She had wasted her own margin. Ahead the corridor still reeled with echoes. She knew the Warden pressed closer, not in body yet, but in pressure that filled her marrow. Delay had thickened into dread. She forced herself forward, slow, each step a debt unpaid.

She thought of warmth rationed beside Kerric. One spark at a time, one vow to move without pause. That vow broke now, beneath the cracking stair. Delay had breached it. She tightened her grip on the lantern. The ember still throbbed. But seconds gone are not returned. The pursuit had narrowed. She felt it in her chest, as if her heart itself were seized and measured. The vault had learned to speak, and its voice was counting her down."""

She gasped, realizing the chase was no longer behind but inside her, altering rhythm of heart, pulling blood faster through veins. She clenched her jaw, yet even her teeth felt enlisted in the hunt.

Light swelled. The lantern’s fissured rim bled glow until it coated her arm, shoulder, chest. Lines of radiance traced bone, fusing her shadow into signal. Each step she took painted the wall with her outline. She tried to dim the lantern, tried to hide, but concealment was no longer hers. The ember had chosen visibility. She was half-signal, half-shield.

A brutal sentence carved through thought: she was changing. Not metaphor, not image. Changing. Flesh became conduit. Pain became seam. She stumbled against the wall, and light seared her outline onto stone, an afterimage of her refusal.

She forced herself forward. Breath tore. In the periphery she saw how frost recoiled from her, retreating before the glow. Pursuit bent closer, but so did survival. The ember had transfigured her into more than bearer. She was becoming vessel. It was unwanted, yet it was armor of a kind.

She walked, luminous and unwilling, a moving torch in corridors that fed on shadow. Each echo, each toll, each crack of frost spoke her doom. And yet, as her skin lit from within, she understood: endurance would not mean carrying the ember. It would mean becoming it."""

She braced against the tremor, lantern jerking in her hand, light clashing with frost-glow that seeped from beneath the ruin. A chamber yawned open below, walls gleaming as if stone had learned to breathe. The collapse deafened the corridor behind; pursuit was stifled, if only for a moment.

She descended into the revealed hollow, ribs aching from strain. The air was mineral-sharp, glittering with crystals that sang against each other when disturbed. Her boots scraped, and the chamber rang like struck glass. Above, debris sealed the breach. Delay for the Warden—reprieve for her.

At the chamber’s heart the frost lit carvings, etched bones of direction. The lantern flared across them and she understood. The markings were fragments of the Ash Veins, maplines embedded in stone long before the gods withdrew. Here was not only hiding but knowledge. She touched one ridge, fingers raw, and heat surged in reply, enough to show the route forward.

She gathered shards from the fall, bone-tools carved with patterns she half-recognized. They echoed her own stitch kit, now doubled, resource renewed. Gain within ruin. Her chest swelled not with triumph but with survival’s thin relief.

Cold pressed still, danger prowled above, but she had won a moment: a path, a tool, a reprieve. Lantern light mingled with frost-glow until chamber walls gleamed like captured dawn. It was not victory. It was enough."""

She lunged at the barrier. Her hands struck frost, nails snapping, blood soaking into white crust that did not yield. She tore at shards, lantern dragging light that shook and scattered on smooth surfaces. Each attempt only widened her wounds. Fingers bled, wrists burned with effort. The chamber answered with silence, stone indifferent, ice unmoved.

The lantern guttered. Warmth she had clutched slipped away with every drop of blood lost into snow. Her ribs heaved, breath fogging against sealed crystal, each exhale failing to find an exit. Time fled, and warmth fled with it. The reprieve had betrayed her.

She leaned against the wall, chest burning. The ember throbbed, but its pulse was small now, hidden in the lantern’s cracked cage. Trapped deeper, she felt pursuit still echoing from beyond, yet unreachable. The loss was immediate: time spent, blood spent, warmth spent. Nothing had opened. Everything had closed.

She lowered her head against stone. Cold claimed her fingers. The ember answered faintly, but even its light seemed distant. Loss had marked its tally. And the chamber held her as if she had never left the vault at all."""

Her breath rasped loud, heart hammering, louder still than the alarms muffled above.

She clutched at needles, gathering some, losing others. Metal kissed ice and rang sharp, mocking her haste. With every second, heat drained. She knew pursuit had not stopped. The tolls grew heavier in the stone, reverberating through marrow, urging her to move, not to crawl on frozen floor. Yet she remained crouched, wasting the margin.

She caught one shard, another, but half the kit eluded her. Numb hands failed their hold. She pressed her face to cold air and cursed with breath too thin. The lantern swung against her side, light smearing the chamber, exposing her failure in full.

The delay thickened around her. Tools half-recovered, strength frayed, warmth bleeding into stone. The Warden’s echo drew nearer with every heartbeat. She rose, staggering, kit diminished, and knew the toll had been exacted. Delay had turned into cost. Time, once hers, was gone."""

A sister—he remembered her face but not the syllables that bound her. Frost had stolen even the word. His breath hung between them, more absence than warmth.

Ilya listened, lantern shaking in her grasp. She understood suddenly: forgetting was not harmless. Each memory lost was as final as death. Each name dropped into silence was another ration gone, warmth slipping past their count. She felt the weight of her own past, faces hovering on the edge of recall, and feared what the frost might erase next.

He turned to her, eyes raw, and whispered that fire was not just heat. Fire was remembering. To forget was to freeze, even if the ember burned bright. The revelation cut deeper than ice: survival meant guarding names, guarding stories, with the same ferocity as guarding flame.

She pressed her forehead to the lantern glass, heat stinging her skin. The ember throbbed like a second heart. She whispered names under breath, her own litany, to keep them alive. One brutal line struck her clarity: to lose memory is to lose fire. The thought stayed, sharp as steel, heavier than the cold itself."""

Her face pressed against the stone for steadiness. The frost there hissed back, melting at her touch. Skin blistered, and the brand deepened. She understood, breath clawing: bearer and ember no longer divisible. Body had become vessel. Pain welded her into the flame’s outline.

She knew the loss before he slipped from her grasp. His body sagged, frost consuming his fingers first, then his breath, then his eyes. The ember dimmed with him, as though sharing his end. Pursuit closed like a lung around her. Warmth gone. Ally gone. Breath stolen."""

Frost split skin to bone, tearing his pace into silence. She dragged him, muscles breaking thread by thread, time pouring out with every useless count.

Her knees struck ice. The lantern dangled loose, glass rattling hollow. Yet the glow pulsed beneath her skin, marrow lit with each heartbeat. She realized the pursuit was not after glass, not after an ember that could be handed off. They wanted the vessel. They wanted her body remade.

Her throat closed, but the truth was clear. Every drag of Kerric, every count, every wasted step had hidden this revelation. The ember had bound itself to her marrow, a covenant not asked but taken. Lantern could shatter; fire would remain inside her. She would burn with it until the end.

The thought stripped her bare. Pursuit thundered. Shadows closed. She rose, shaking, no lantern needed. The revelation cut simple: she was the flame. And they hunted her blood."""

Her legs did not falter now. Every vein burned, each pulse throwing strength through sinew. Pain did not vanish—it sharpened—but pain became propulsion. The tunnel’s collapse behind her sounded like pursuit falling short. She felt her ribs expand, breath tearing but full, her stride lengthening until shadow fell back.

The Warden’s echo staggered. Even its relentless chase paused at the shock of her sudden pace. She felt distance open—scarce but real. The ember had given her not mercy but power. It poured raw into muscle, granting her a gain that seared as it saved.

She did not thank it. She only ran, faster than she thought her body could. Fire bit her bones, but each bite gave speed. For this moment, she was not prey. She was pace itself, and pursuit faltered."""

Revelation struck her ribs like hammer. These were not reflections. They were futures. Each shard showed a body already rewritten, fire laced through its veins, mouth open with light. She had thought she carried the ember, but here the ember had written her. Identity stripped and rewritten. Vessel, not bearer. There was no return.

Her body a furnace choking on its own ash. She felt it with every step. Fire pressed out, re-shaping her frame until she knew the truth with bone-deep clarity: she would never be whole again, only burning. The faces confirmed it, each showing another version walking deeper into flame.

She reached to touch the glass, but the shard seared her palm. Skin smoked. She pulled back, the fire inside answering, burning brighter. She understood then: the ember had chosen, and it had chosen her as its shape. The path was already inscribed. Ahead lay only fire."""

Her knees buckled as if frost struck her marrow. Pain raced like iron through her veins. Then heat devoured it, drowning every nerve until nothing remained but flame’s command. She gasped, but the sound was not air—it was fire hissing through her teeth. She was no longer carrier. She was fire-wrapped flesh.

Her outline blurred, skin shining with a molten sheen. Shadows that chased her faltered. The Warden slowed, no longer certain of prey. They saw not a woman fleeing, but a figure burning, ungraspable, impossible to claim. In that sudden moment pursuit lost its anchor.

The cavern’s mirrored faces no longer reflected her—they shattered into light, unable to hold the new shape. What stood in their place was something uncontained, marrow burned clean of doubt. She staggered upright, flesh crackling, every step a flare of her new self. Pursuit could not close in. She had been rewritten by fire."""

Her arms flailed once for balance, nails scraping against the wall’s glasslike face. Sparks flashed, died. The ember throbbed but would not leap. Breath came ragged, time lost with every inhale that gave no strength. Pursuit filled the silence with its thunder.

Her hunter was her marrow. Her marrow was her enemy. She could not run from it because she was running with it, carrying it closer with every step.

When she spoke, the ember pulsed. Their eyes answered, catching a faint spark, as if the fire chose to mark them at first meeting. Their breath shivered with sudden heat, then steadied. They did not step back. They understood. Oath had already altered them.

The docks groaned, brittle beneath their weight, as if the world itself acknowledged the bargain. The fellowship was born not from trust, but from fire’s demand. Transformation widened: not only Ilya, but all who stood with her carried ember’s touch. Cost was declared before the journey even began."""

They marked the route together. The sailor traced the coastline, the scribe—still coughing from frost—nodded with the recognition of landmarks. For once they saw more than debts; they saw a path. The fellowship, bent by loss, closed again around this gain.

The ember pulsed in Ilya’s chest. Its flare spread into her arms, warming her companions as if acknowledging the offering. Each felt it briefly: fingers unclenched, breath no longer torn. It was a shared warmth, a gift as fleeting as bubbles on the tide.

The thief’s eyes darted, calculating still, but the map was theirs, and the path was clear. For a moment, unity did not feel like burden. It felt like direction. It felt like gain. The ember agreed, and its glow steadied them through the salted dark."""

Delay stole distance, and the fellowship felt it with every dragging step. The cold grew heavier, the ember dimmer. Still they moved, slower, slower, each breath sounding like a clock striking against their chests, counting down what little distance remained."""

Then the echoes shifted. Footsteps behind fell into perfect rhythm with the light before. Ilya heard the Warden’s tread and realized it did not seek—it was guided. The same fire that marked their path also lit his. The ember had not been compass for them alone; it was beacon, shining to predator as to bearer.

The revelation struck her like ice in marrow. She saw every advantage inverted. Their gain was his gain. Their hope was his guide. Fire had never been only hers—it belonged equally to the pursuit. She knew then the ember would not only burn her; it would consume them all.

The fellowship marched slower after that. Each step forward felt like dragging the Warden with them, tied by light they could not extinguish. The candle’s glow was revelation, and it betrayed as much as it promised."""

They called to one another. Voices muffled, direction blurred. The sailor’s laugh, so sharp when he found the fish, became a curse lost in vapor. One figure turned wrong, and when the fog thinned, that place was empty. No body, no trace—just the hush of mist closing again.

Strength had returned with food, but absence undid it. Each step forward dragged with the weight of the missing. Ilya felt the ember heavier, its warmth less a promise than a debt unpaid. The fellowship was thinner now, not by ice or blade, but by the veiling of the world itself. Loss without witness, loss without sound, only fog where once there was a face."""

Her hand closed on the traitor’s wrist, ember flaring from her chest into her palm. The heat seared through flesh, a brand carved in fire. He screamed, voice cut ragged, and the smell of scorched skin curled into the night air.

She did not release him. She forced his hand open, pressed until the ember’s light etched a scar across his palm. When she finally let go, the mark glowed red, a wound shaped like loyalty though born of pain. The map clattered to the ground between them, no longer his to barter.

The fellowship watched, horror mingled with grim relief. The betrayer staggered, clutching his branded hand. His oath was renewed, not by choice but by fire. He would walk with them, unwilling guide marked by the ember’s authority.

Trust was gone. The fellowship was altered, fused not by belief but by scar. What was burned could not be undone. Their path bent with this transformation, and every step forward would carry the weight of his branded flesh, the smell of betrayal turned into obedience."""

The companions drew back. This was not loyalty reforged; it was will erased, speech enslaved. They understood then that the ember’s brand was no scar but a fissure. Through it the fire leaked, claiming tongue and breath as its own.

Bronze dulled by years, yet its seal shone clear: a city long fallen, its crest etched deep. Around the rim, faint lines traced a path, not ornament but route, a secret carried in metal.

The companions leaned closer. For all the loss, for all the fracture, here was direction. Shelter whispered in grooves of a forgotten mint. The ember’s fire gleamed across its face, revealing roads unseen on any parchment. They gained more than coin—they gained a map written in alloy and shadow.

But the air shifted, uneasy. Fortune’s glint cut sharp. The coin’s knowledge was not free. To follow its path meant binding themselves tighter to the ember, and to the fate it carried. The Warden would hunt not only the flame but now the trail it illuminated.

Still, hands closed around the coin, clutching the seal of a lost city. Gain undeniable. Destiny narrowed, sharpened, seared into their grasp like metal just lifted from the forge."""

Breath rattled in their chests. The ember gave little light, flickering weak as if unwilling to spend itself on waiting.

Food was measured out in crumbs. Each hour stretched, thin as glass. The fellowship lingered too long. Silence gathered, broken only by muffled gasps and the scrape of needle against stiffened cloth. Every moment delayed them, every pause another thread pulled loose from their chance.

Behind, the world seemed to listen. A pressure rose, unseen but drawing nearer. The Warden’s steps were not heard, yet the air thickened as if announcing its approach. Time lost could not be reclaimed, and their care—gentle, necessary—was also their ruin.

She pressed the smoke into herself. Heat raced across her skin, searing veins as if rewriting them. Lines drew themselves under her flesh, black-red tracery branching down her arms, across her throat. She gasped, lips cracked by cold, tasting metal where a thread had cut. Memory was no longer parchment; it was scar, fire-drawn and living.

The fellowship staggered back. They saw their guide remade, maps burned from page into body. No one else could hold the path now. The ember had carved knowledge straight into her blood. They would follow her because nothing else remained.

When she rose, her eyes burned with roads. The snow could not erase them. The Warden could not seize them. But the fellowship knew the price: their leader had become both map and burden, a body branded into direction. The path forward was etched in her skin, unerasable, searing with every step."""

Yet the gain bound them. The ruin’s yield came because of her voice, her ember-driven arithmetic. They knew now that every path forward, every resource, came through her flame. Relief was edged with the iron tether of dependence.

The ember had not spared her by accident—it had chosen. Its surge consumed others so that she might endure. She stood unscathed while ash drifted where a companion had been.

One voice whispered the truth aloud: the fire would feed on them to preserve her. The fellowship froze, each hearing what they already knew. Cold recognition cut deeper than wind. Their survival was no longer shared. It hung only on her endurance, on the flame she bore, ruthless in its selection.

Ilya felt the truth strike her as hard as the frost. She was not leader by courage, nor guide by will. She was vessel, and the vessel remained by the fire’s demand. Each step forward was not earned but bought in others’ bodies. Revelation rang cold as iron, and no one spoke again as they moved on, their silence a consent they could not refuse."""

Fire crackled, sharp, real, not ember-born but earth’s old fuel. Heat bled back into their fingers, and for a breath the fellowship remembered living.

Laughter broke the silence, harsh and brief but human. They warmed, stretched stiff limbs, counted fewer losses. The ember dimmed in their minds for an instant, as if displaced by common flame. Yet with smoke rose danger. It curled out through vents, a black script written across the white air. Skyward it climbed, a beacon no storm could erase. Even in warmth, dread quickened: their gain would draw eyes.

Ilya watched the fire and knew it bought them hours, nothing more. The coal’s reprieve was sharp, welcome, and costly. Somewhere beyond the horizon the Warden would see the plume and move closer. The fellowship sat in the glow, warmed, renewed, and marked for the hunt."""

Frost split her skin, yet beneath it heat rose, and each drop of blood hissed against the surface. Her ascent began not as climb but as sacrifice, every hold taken with burning palms, every step an offering. The stone devoured her flesh and returned flame in its place.

Her fingers changed first. Nails peeled away, leaving ember-bright shards where keratin had been. Light crawled under her skin, ribs aglow, each exhale a plume of smoke. The climb offered no retreat. Muscles tore and knit anew, fibers shot through with fire. Flesh thinned, became translucent, veins like glass filaments threaded with light. Blood warmed like struck iron. She was no longer wholly mortal.

The fellowship watched but did not follow. Some tried; most failed. The path rejected them. Their breaths stilled against the wall’s indifference. One by one they let go. Ilya alone remained, her body consumed yet sustained, every inch higher binding her more tightly to the ember. She climbed into transformation, becoming what none else could: flame given form, body yielding, soul smelted to fire’s demand."""

Her palms smoked against the wall, melting frost, leaving prints of seared rock. The husk of the dead sun did not resist. It yielded, softened, as if it recognized its own heat within her. Each motion struck like lightning. The mountain seemed less obstacle than extension of her transformed body.

Behind her, companions faltered. Their breaths hitched not from cold but from the sight of her. They saw power not borrowed but possessed, as if the ember had claimed her fully. Fear mingled with awe. She climbed without falter, marrow a furnace, skin a veil thinning, her form more fire than flesh.

It was inscribed.

Companions shifted uneasily, hearing it too, though they lacked the sight. The frost retreated in veins of clarity, script cutting across the broken path. She bent low and traced the lines, the ember in her grip answering with a harder glow. The words formed plain: not chance, not metaphor, but command.

“One bearer, one fire—others must fade.” She read it aloud, voice brittle as ice. Silence followed, sharper than cold. Companions looked at her with dread that was no longer only fear of the journey but fear of her. The path had spoken, and its decree was merciless."""

The inscription glowed faint, as if fed, not by fire but by loss. She tried to reach, to lift him, but the ember held her hand back, its heat surging, its warning absolute. The flame was spared. His life was not. The cost had been set by something deeper than mercy: stone trading warmth for blood.

They moved on, one fewer again. No words filled the space he left. Only the scrape of boots against frozen path, the ember’s pulse harsher now, the silence widened to swallow them. The command had spoken, and it had collected its due."""

Her flesh was gone in that rising. Ash fell, silent, weightless, carried wide across the plain.
