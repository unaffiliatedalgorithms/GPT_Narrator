**Scene 0.0.0.0:**

```
Half-light lay thin on the stone, a scum of dawn that never warmed, only revealed the filth of age in the treads. She put her boot to the first step and felt the grit shift, counted it. One for the crack in her breath. Two for the way the rail threw back the chill. Three for the ache that had nested between the knuckles of her burned hand long before the burn. Four. Five. Six. Numbers were a rope she could hold with her teeth when her fingers failed.

The stair well spiraled like a black ribcage; the vaults had been carved by hands that believed forever was a thing you could quarry. At thirty she paused, and the air answered her with that low chime the stones always held, a humming that lived just beneath hearing and shook the balance bones. She felt it through the soles, a tremor that measured her, and said: run, or freeze. She closed her eyes and listened again, as if listening could give her a different command. It did not. The sound rode up the marrow.

Thirty-one. Thirty-two. The gate crouched in front of her like a jaw clamped shut. A door meant for gods to slip through without touching the world. The seam ran down the middle, lapped and sealed with the slick of old prayers. She unwrapped the bone-needle, fish-white and sharp, from the leather strip she kept tucked inside her sleeve. Her breath came in plumes. It fogged the godglass case in the niche beside the gate until the case was a ghost, and her face in it was another ghost answering.

She whispered the numbers again, not as tally but as plea. Her body had begun to choose for her, shaking in small, sided shivers that began in the calves and climbed. “Hold,” she told the legs. “Hold.” She steadied the needle and set its tip to the seam. At the first touch, the vault answered with that same subharmonic note, as if she had plucked the rib of a buried harp. The sound did not echo. It gathered behind the ear and pressed. The seam did not care about her fear. It cared about pressure and angle and time, and she could give it all three.

She worked by feel because light lied and numbness lied worse. The needle worried the seam; she rocked it, gentled it, then leaned as if persuading a stubborn friend to stand. The old seal gave under the bone with the small surrendering sound of fat under a knife. The case exhaled a stale sweetness, temple incense turned to rot. The chime deepened. Something in the foundations began to wake—the Warden’s slumber had been as thin as mercy.

For a heartbeat—no, measure it—two heartbeats—she considered delaying. She could leave the flame for a better hour, for a day with more heat in it, for someone less breakable, for a map that was not a rumor she carried under her tongue. She could go back up the stair, count backwards, pretend the cold would be gentler if she met it empty-handed. She could. She did not.

She slid the case door back with the edge of her good hand. The ember waited in its cradle, no larger than an infant’s fist, a clot of dull red in the godglass. The world around it was colder for its nearness, like a mouth numb with mint. She brought the lantern close, the cracked rim leaking a crescent of reflected light that made her own eye look fissured. The lantern’s hinge clicked. Her breath fogged and cleared, fogged and cleared, and between fogs she saw her palm laid bare, skin chapped to grades of white and angry rose.

“Now,” the chime said without words; and, “Now,” the cold repeated; and the alarms on the far side of the vault—metal tongues that had not moved in a century—flexed like cats in sleep.

She took the ember with her bare hand.

Heat found every nerve like a hunter that knew the terrain. It didn’t rush; it chose. It nested into the web between thumb and forefinger, set its teeth, and bit down. The pain was a clean bell struck in meat. She swallowed a sound that would have summoned the Warden faster than the alarms could. The ember was heavier than it looked. She had thought it would float in its own fever. It did not. It dragged at the tendons. It asked for a share of her fist and then of her arm and then of her center, as if it were taking rent in quick increments.

She did not let go. She dropped it into the lantern’s belly. The godglass sang as it closed, a thin, high answer to the subharmonic bass of the stone. Heat leaked out around the hairline fracture along the rim and kissed the outside air. Her skin puffed in blisters where the kiss landed. A hush followed, a momentary vacuum as if the flame had inhaled the room and held it in a lung. The hush broke with the first alarm bell waking fully, a cracked bronze cough.

Run, or freeze.

The stair behind her was a mouth that wanted her bones. Ahead: a corridor ribbed with arch supports, the floor scored by sled runners and the footprints of men who had believed hunger would never visit them. The cold made metal ring. She heard the Warden’s voice through the vents, not a word but a pressure that rearranged her decisions into categories: permitted, forbidden, punishable. The ember turned the lantern into a small sun in her hand, and the small sun drew eyes.

She ran. Short sentences for a while. Feet. Breath. Shoulder to door. Lantern high. Count the distances: five to the turn, eight to the kink where the arch sagged, eleven to the ladder, thirteen to the hatch that had been painted shut with age. She slammed into that hatch with the good shoulder and felt the wood say Not yet. She did not believe it. She set the lantern down, pulled the little pry from her belt—the one she had ground down from the spoke of a wagon wheel in a town that had frozen hard enough to preserve even names—and worked it under the paint seam. Splinters sifted over her boots like a quiet snow.

Behind and above, the Warden set a weight against the air. The pressure thickened. The chime answered with a faster pulse. Her breath came sharp; her burned hand throbbed in its own count, an off-beat that wanted attention. She thought of the rations in her pack: three bricks of fat felt, two vials of beet-sugar syrup, a twist of salt she had promised herself would last a week. She thought of the map in her breast wrap, ink thinned until the veins of passage looked like hair fallen on a sink.

Choice is always a theft from some future.

She levered the hatch. It popped, not graciously but with a snap like a tendon making up its mind. Cold flooded in—not the stale cold of sealed rooms but the moving cold of outer air that found and inhabited every cavity of the body. She reached for the lantern to set it through first and in that instant the Warden spoke in a voice that used the ductwork for chords: “Thief.” The word hit so hard it cut a fraction out of time, the way a wave breaks a stride. Her hand stuttered. The lantern wobbled. A vial slid out of her side pocket, tapped the edge of the floor, and fell.

Loss has a crisp sound. The glass tink was small and particular. The syrup darkened as it spread, then froze sugar-white in a skin. One warmth unit gone. She blinked, stupidly, as if sight could reverse arithmetic.

“Move,” she told herself, and the command landed. She slung the pack, shoved the lantern through the hatch, and hauled her body after. The metal lip caught her thigh; pain kept its receipts. Behind, the Warden’s weight bore down. The hatch’s hinge screamed as she pulled it closed. She kicked the pry into the seam and stamped it home. A second vial rolled and she trapped it with her heel. Not this one. Not today.

The corridor beyond was an alley cleft between buildings whose windows had been hoarded with ice like inward-looking eyes. Snow had crusted into slick plates; the lantern’s heat woke fog that pressed up and around her face, a temporary veil that made the world a set of moving white surfaces. She knew the city’s edge lay seven turns away if she took the gutter path, nine if she kept to the spine. The Warden would expect the spine; it was clean, navigable, quick. The gutter path held rubble, broken culverts, a drop where the street had caved into a cellar full of iron teeth. She chose the gutter.

We choose the routes that match our damage.

She moved low, lantern tucked under the cloak to dim its broadcast, breath hissing against wool. The chime came with her, small now, no longer the voice of stone but the memory of it. The lantern’s crack bled a knife of light; she shaped her hand over it and felt the heat print itself across the blisters in a grid. Counting steadied her. She measured turns and heartbeats and the way her vision narrowed at the edges when the air bit too hard. She named: one brick; two vials; six breaths until the next cover. To keep the numbers honest, she cut them into syllables and lodged each under a tooth.

At the third turn a shape detached from a shadow and came toward her with a stagger meant to be read as weakness. She did not read it that way. Men came to the vaults to take what took them back, and some of them lived long enough to learn how to pretend. “Share the light,” the shape said, and a second voice—no, the same voice, thrown off a wall—said, “or share the cold.” She thought of refusing and of killing and of bargaining. Her lantern was a summons; her rations were a ledger too thin to balance strangers. She kept moving. The shape paced her for four steps and then peeled off toward a whisper of heat the lantern had left on the air, a dog following a scent it could not eat.

By the fifth turn the alarms had spread through the drowned city like a rumor. People she could not see had started counting too. The Warden’s sound—less voice than permission to be cruel—worked on them. She tasted copper. The gutter path spat her into a courtyard where a black tree had grown in reverse, its roots exposed like antlers, its branches sunk under paving stone. She could cross the courtyard in twelve strides or circle the edges in thirty. The center was faster but open. The edges were slower but watchful. She made the twelve and accepted what watched.

Something fell from above and exploded near her shoulder; stone chips peppered her cheek. She ducked without breaking stride. She had learned years ago that if you duck and stop you die. The lantern swung; the crack made a spark-lash on a drifting pane of ice that turned it briefly into a mirror, and in that mirror she saw herself with the ember burning in a small, stern circle and knew she was now the target and the hearth both. The knowledge made a place in her chest and sat down.

At the wall beyond the courtyard, an old maintenance hatch leaned half-open, snow-lipped. She tried it. Hinges gave. She squeezed through into pipes and steam ghosts. The city’s old blood. Metal breathed here in slow contractions; the heat startled tears out of her eyes that froze into a salt shine in her lashes. She took one long breath and felt her lungs remember what air could be. A laugh came up and she bit it, not out of fear of echo but because joy spent itself too quickly in such weather.

Her hand hurt. Her hand was the world. She took the strip of linen from her kit and bound the blisters without ceremony. The skin had raised like new land after a drought. “Price,” she said, neither complaining nor proud. She unstoppered the surviving vial and let a single drop of syrup coat her tongue. The sweetness unspooled across nerves the ember had scalded. She closed her eyes, counted to eight, opened them. The Warden’s pressure lessened in the pipes; the metal here did not love him.

Two choices ahead: back to the spine where pursuit would be quick and certain but the exits many, or down through the maintenance runs to the salt culverts that led out under the city wall, narrow, wet, a place to freeze if she miscounted or a place to live if she remembered to keep moving. She pictured Kerric’s face—but no, she did not know him yet. The memory was future. The thought of company arrived like a rumor that warmed without feeding.

She chose the culverts.

She lowered herself into the throat of the city and let the lantern lead with its cracked grin. The chime slid down the scale, softer. She moved by numbers again: six rungs, drop; three paces, bend; four, crouch. Water lipped her boot and a spider of ice fastened there, each leg a stitch in a pattern she would wear across miles if she got those miles. The ember’s heat set an aura in the fog ahead. She watched it touch the world and make it briefly itself, then vanish. The culvert carried her forward with the slow grace of a body being born, and the city’s hunger stayed above her like a weather that could not quite reach.

This, she thought, is the work. Not prophecy. Not hymn. Arithmetic and pain, and the refusal to release a thing that would rather live in fire than in a hand. So she went, counting, while behind her the Warden gathered a different kind of number, adding floors and doors and throats to a sum that would end, one day, in the same room as hers.
```

**Scene 0.0.0.1:**

```
She had refused release. That was the hinge—heat had closed its teeth into her palm and she did not open the hand. In the echo of that decision, the seam across the godglass answered as if agreement were a sound: a deepened note thrummed in the stone ribs of the vault, the pressure through her soles tightening, the door’s lip waking to the language of force. She steadied her wrist against the jamb to tame the tremor pain had dug into the tendons. Pressure and angle. Repay patience.

She brought the bone-needle back to work, its fish-pale shaft ticking against the line of prayer-wax that had glued the case shut when the gods still believed in their own permanence. The wax crumbled in brittle curls that clung to the needle and to the cuticle of her thumb. She scraped, not gentle, not cruel, simply with the exactitude of a woman who has learned that the world opens to persistence more often than to talent. The chime underfoot climbed a half-tone when she found a hairline within the seam, a shallow channel chased with glyphs so fine the eye could mistake them for scratches. She did not trust eyes. She trusted the way vibration changed when a path was true.

She followed that hairline as if it were a rivercourse inked on old hide, the needle a skiff nudging through mud and reed. The sound continued to instruct—tiny rises where the glyphs bent, a drop when the channel thickened, a held note at junctions that said choose left, not right. It felt like counting with the skin instead of the tongue, a mathematics the vault had prepared for hands like hers long before she was born. Even the hurt helped; the burn in her palm brightened every nerve and made her precise. Pain kept her honest when haste wanted to make lies.

Cold draped around her, cloth upon cloth. Breath whitened until it was a veil and then a frost-veil stuck to her lip. She peeled it back with the back of her wrist and blinked the sting clear. “Keep moving,” she told the hand, the arm, the shoulders that had begun to pull tight against themselves. The lantern at her hip coughed heat through its crack, a small animal’s breath. The ember within, newly swallowed, had the weight of an oath. She adjusted the lantern so the godglass belly shone toward the seam. Light pooled along the wax; the wax bled. The glyphs came up in relief like pale knuckles through skin.

She pried out a longer ribbon of sealant. A smell rose—incense rotted down to a sweet-sour that had lost its reason and kept only the habit of sweetness. “Old prayers,” she said, not respectful, not mocking, as one might remark on the pattern left by vanished rain. As she worked, the bone clicked softly; the needle’s tip had split. She spat into her palm and rubbed the tip against the grit on the step to make a new edge. The grit bit back, grounding her. Cold owns her. The thought didn’t shame; it named.

The chime changed again, deeper now, a throat-sound that suggested the door felt her logic. The pressure of the Warden’s attention, still distant, eddied in the vents like a weather front circling. She had minutes or less before that weather arrived. But she also had the right sequence under her hands, a string of notes that mapped to motions: slide, rock, twist, lift. If she hurried, she would blunder and make a second job out of a first job, and the vault would laugh closed. If she tarried, she would drown in the voice that called thief and made her blood heavy. There are choices that give you two kinds of drowning.

She steadied the needle, then did not move at all for one long held breath. In that stillness her ear took the measure of the room: the way the low note throbbed against the bones just in front of her ear, the faint metal breath of the lantern as its hinge expanded in heat and then shrank back, the distant tick of ice settling in a corridor beyond. Hearing placed her within the map. When she moved again she made each motion the size of a word no larger than necessary. The seam began to admit the needle’s shaft. She leaned and felt the give. The case did not swing open. It slid back a finger-width with the dignity of old things that consent, not capitulate. Cold rushed out like water, it had weight, and with it a scentless emptiness that pulled air out of her mouth and made the chest ache as if a hand had squeezed the lungs to coins.

“Good,” she said to no one, and then, softer, “Good enough.”

She reached for the rim and checked the crack with a thumbnail, a habit as ingrained as the lift-check she’d used in street markets to judge rotten fruit. Not wider. Still a hairline. She layered the strip of leather she kept for burns along her palm and forefinger and opened the door the rest of the way by degrees, stopping at each complaint to listen for the way complaint changed. Behind the case, gears she could not see tripped into muted action. The chime branched, multiples on the same base note: three soft strikes, a rest, two, a long one. She recognized it without understanding why she did. Not a signal to her; a conversation among machines, telling one another which prohibitions had been broken and in what order.

Alarms stirred in the far halls—a shifting of weight on great tongues of metal, a throat-clearing not yet a shout. The vault breathed in, measuring her. She breathed out and made her body as narrow as her aim. She wormed the needle up the last stubborn pocket of wax and flicked it clear. The glyph channel ceased. She had cleaned the path of the old logic. No more notes. Only the open. Only the plain work of hands and hinge and hinge’s refusal.

She did not look at the ember yet. Looking at the thing you want before you have secured the room is a way to teach the room your weakness. She checked the jamb, the pin, the hinge-screw she could reach, the counterweight rope where it entered stone. She tested the counterweight with a tug and felt the stone answer with a tiny yielding, which told her the block had not frozen solid and would move if commanded. The vault was an old animal that could still wake.

She pressed with her shoulder and found the angle where the case’s door stopped arguing and began to assist. She let it come. Cold spilled in honest floods and set needles all down her burned hand where the leather had slipped. The pain’s edge cut so clean it clarified. In that clarity the world simplified: seam, hinge, needle, chime, the beat of her heart, the count. She let numbers anchor each act. One: slide. Two: rest. Three: check the rope, check the pin, check the lantern’s breath. Four: brace. Five: listen. Six: move.

The door stood open. Inside, the ember cupped its dull red like a secret spoken in a language made of heat. She did not reach yet. The discipline was not superstition; it was the scaffolding of survival in a room that had been engineered to make thieves hurry. She sat back on her heels, shook the sting out of the burned hand, then brought both hands—one to take, one to ready the lantern mouth. “From here,” she told herself, “no ornaments.” She set the lantern beneath the opening with the practiced care of a carpenter placing the first board, this edge square to this line, so that the house does not lean.

Then—only then—she took it.

Heat struck hard, as it had, but she had prepared the nerves with orders and with steady air. The bite still sought the tendon and tried to climb the forearm. She allowed no ladder. She put the ember straight into its glass home and shut the door on it, hearing the high answer inside, and with that the room became a little less a room and more a throat leading out. The chime underfoot gave a last authoritative pulse as if a teacher had said, Lesson complete, now run.

She did not run yet. The last of the seal still clung in the track. She swept it with the back of the needle and shoved it into a pocket; wax could be warmth later if burned slow. She cleared the lip, reseated the lantern on its hook so it would not swing wild, and at that the first of the true alarm bells found its full weight and let it fall. The sound coughed the air. Dust lifted from the beams like breath made visible. “Move,” she said, and then, stripping thought down to motor: “Now.”

She turned from the case and felt the pressure of the Warden’s attention tighten the atmosphere to half-density. That pressure would make the next doors heavy; it would advise the hinges to remember cold. She placed a palm on the jamb—the burned one, because pain made clear—and told the bone how to behave: do not shake. The hand obeyed. She gathered the needle, the leather, the pry. She did not leave tools where a mind like the Warden’s might read them and learn her timing. Then she crossed to the stair she had counted and began the flight she had calculated, but every step ran back through the seam—the angle, the pressure, the way the sound had taught her the mathematics of opening—and that backward running steadied the forward body.

Keep moving.

She carried the revelation out with her: that the vault sang not just a warning but a method, that some divine engineer had left in the enemy a way for a human ear and hand to enter, that even failures of gods arrive with seams. She would need that later. She placed it in memory the way one stores a flint: wrapped, reachable, named. The alarms gathered volume. The bell’s second cough became a shout. Air shivered. Ice ticked in the ducts like teeth.

At the threshold she looked once over her shoulder at the case she had opened. It looked smaller now, not because she had diminished it, but because the work of opening remade her measure. She had paid heat, skin, sugar; she had been paid with method, with a map that lived in her blood now, with the fact that her patience could alter old law. That knowledge warmed no room. It warmed resolve. She felt its thin fire and set her shoulders to the door that would not want to let her pass.

There are moments when the right map is a sound. There are moments when the right prayer is not a word but a pressure measured in the pad of a thumb and named later only so you can pass it on. She held those in mind as she slipped through the hatch and into the cold that would try to unmake what she had just made, and then, because the world demands simple things after it allows a revelation, she did the next necessary, ordinary task: she put one foot in front of the other and refused to stop until the next hinge answered her with the note that meant yes.

**Scene 0.0.0.2:**

The glass mouth yawned farther. Cold surged through the gap and pressed into her chest like a flat plate. Breath stuttered, condensed, burned in reverse. She coughed and the cough hurt in ways the burn had not, tearing small vessels, leaving her throat raw and bitter with iron. The chamber did not wait. Air became a weight that filled her with winter and she staggered one step back before she caught herself against the jamb. Lungs had no patience. She forced air out and dragged it in again, rough, animal, each swallow of atmosphere a bargain with knives.

Her hand was still fused to the ember. Skin blistered, but it was not the pain that held—it was adhesion. The glow had softened her palm until it bound to glass and heat, an unwanted solder. She pulled, and the hand refused her. She hissed through the clenched teeth, leaned, yanked. Flesh stretched. The ember did not fall. There are prisons that burn hotter than any shackle.

Alarms chose that instant to wake in truth. Bronze throats that had only muttered before bellowed. The sound did not echo; it imposed. It demanded attention from marrow, forced joints to shiver. Steps shook. Dust sifted down like snow that meant collapse. The whole stairwell seemed ready to heave itself aside. Delay. Every heartbeat lost became a gift to the hunter above.

She dropped to her knees, braced the wrist with her other arm, and drove a strip of linen between skin and glass. The cloth smoked. She shoved until it caught and peeled part of her palm free. Flesh tore; the ember’s heat scrawled itself deeper. She bit down on her sleeve until cloth and teeth creaked. The lantern stood open. She tilted the cursed weight toward its belly. The ember fell with a hiss of defeat, rolled into place, lit the chamber with its one-eyed glow. The glass door clicked shut. Breath loosened slightly, though the alarms still roared.

She cradled her palm. Blisters wept. The linen fused there, a new skin. Not whole, but serviceable. Time had been lost. She counted it: three beats too many at the seam, seven kneeling in cold, the loss equal to one ration of warmth. She had learned to count because numbers do not lie where hope can. She muttered the tally to fix it: “One brick, two vials, one hand broken.”

The stair groaned. Pursuit was coming. Delay had fed it. She stood, dizzy, but upright. She wrenched the lantern back to her hip and forced her burned fingers to curl. Each curl a refusal. Delay was debt. She would pay it in blood or in distance, but the account would be exact. She spat red into the frost, gripped the rail, and began the run that pain had postponed.
```

**Scene 0.0.1.0:**

```
The lantern took the ember with a shudder, as if unwilling to be its jailer. Hairline fracture along the rim bled strands of light that stitched themselves into her wrist. Skin hissed. She smelt herself cooking, the nauseous stink of burning leather and meat, but she did not drop it. Flame threaded through the crack and branded her again, a signature deeper than any oath. Pain insisted on abandonment; choice reshaped it into endurance.

The chamber recoiled. A hush bulged outward and then folded inward, the vault’s air drawn into a sudden vacuum. She staggered two steps, knees bending as though an unseen hand pressed down on her shoulders. Balance returned only when she caught the jamb with the seared arm, nerves sparking their protest. The silence carried weight, not absence. It hummed like a tightening rope.

Then heat came fully, unmediated. The lantern glowed white at the seams, casting untrustworthy shapes against the stone. Walls shivered; dust sluiced down in threads, and each grain sang with static. The alarms, newly born, married the dust into one perception: the sound of metal throats bellowing while the world blurred with powdered stone, each cough of the bronze joined to falling grit and the thunder of the hunter’s footfall. The vault itself convulsed around her, reminding her that pursuit was not only behind but within.

She lifted the lantern higher. It had become both burden and beacon, light spilling like water through every flaw, announcing her path to any that hunted. Shadows fled and returned in the same breath. The ember was no longer contained; it had transformed the vessel, and by extension, her. Her body bore the mark. Flesh blackened, skin cracked, nerves sang dissonant hymns of fire. She understood in that blink that she had ceased to be merely a thief of gods. She was becoming a lantern herself—an unwilling lighthouse in a land of predators.

Her breath hitched, then steadied. She wrapped the ruined hand with linen strips torn from her sleeve, but light still seeped between the weave. She cursed, knowing concealment was no longer possible. To hold on was to signal. Yet to release was death. Burden and beacon entangled; she chose both.

Smoke thickened in the hall, acrid and hot, the byproduct of ancient mechanisms cracking open under strain. She coughed, forcing air through a throat raw from frost and flame, and began forward. Every step left her more visible. Yet each step was survival. She held to that paradox: beaconhood as betrayal, pain as path, transformation forced upon her by an ember that had chosen her flesh for its scripture. She moved, scar newly written, and knew the Warden would follow the light, and that was its own form of doom.
```

**Scene 0.0.1.1:**

```
The hush did not stay a silence. It thickened, turned heavy, and pressed into her ribs until breath fractured into stutters. The air folded inward as if the vault had learned how to inhale, and she was only another lungful to be claimed. Alarms clanged above, their voices multiplied, not echo but accumulation, until every step and grain of dust trembled with their demand. She reeled sideways, lantern held high, balance failing on stone that suddenly seemed angled against her.

Then the ceiling cracked. A beam, swollen with frost and centuries of waiting, surrendered. It fell with the blunt intent of execution. She twisted, shoulders wrenching, and threw herself across the stair. Splinters and snow-slag exploded against her back. The lantern nearly tore free, but her burned hand locked around its loop, refusing. She hit the floor hard. Pain hammered through her ribs. Alive. Beam shattered beside her, scattering shards that still steamed with cold. Survival was not grace; it was theft.

She rolled to her knees, coughing stone-dust. The vault reeked of old timber and scorched resin. One path was blocked, but another opened: a fissure where the beam had ripped free left a low tunnel into the side passage. She seized it without thought. The alarms made pursuit certain, but delay had transformed into advantage. Collapse had carved her an escape route where none had stood.

She crawled, ribs bruised, lantern dragging light that bent across the dust. The beam’s fall had gifted her momentum—she felt it in the quickened pulse, in the clarity that sometimes follows near-death. Pain did not dull; it focused. Each inhalation hurt, but hurt made her lungs measure true. Numbers returned. She counted distances again: three spans to crawl, two breaths to clear the gap, one decision to commit. She took them all.

Behind, the hall choked with the Warden’s pressure, the weight that bent air and stone alike. Ahead, the crack widened toward outer cold. She pressed on, soot thickening her sweat, frost searing the edges of her wounds. But she gained—time stolen, distance won, a narrow lead. Her ribs throbbed, her palm wept blisters, her throat tore with each cough, but she carried both pain and ember, and for the moment, that was enough gain to matter.
```

**Scene 0.0.1.2:**

```
Heat became enemy. It swelled, ungoverned, pouring from seams in the lantern until sight dimmed under white haze. Smoke crawled into her mouth and clogged her lungs. She drove herself forward through it, ribs aching, only to find nothing beneath her next step. The floor fell away. She plunged to her knee on jagged rock, lantern smashing against stone. Glass bit her palm anew. She heard it: a brittle chip breaking loose, a shard of fire scattering.

On the floor, amid smoke, an ember-splinter writhed once, light frantic as a trapped insect. She reached, fingers trembling, but heat shrieked against her broken skin. It guttered, rolled to stone fissure, and was gone. Darkness rushed in, heavier for the fragment lost. Not all flame could be kept. The lantern’s heart still throbbed, but lighter, diminished, a reminder that store of hope had been shortened.

She bit down on despair, but its taste was salt and blood. She remembered a voice—Kerric’s—sworn under collapsing eaves, “We ration warmth together.” The echo struck bitter now. Together had shrunk to one. She clenched the wounded hand, knowing the ember’s measure was reduced, the price for stumbling paid in kind. She rose through smoke, each breath stabbing raw lungs, and held the lantern close, its leaking glare narrower, dimmer.

Loss was carved into the journey. She walked on with it as companion, not enemy, but companion that took without asking, companion that would always demand more. She pressed forward, ribs sore, palm scorched, throat torn. Ahead waited only pursuit, and behind a fragment already ash. The count had changed. Hope measured less. That was truth.
```

**Scene 0.0.2.0:**

```
The smoke writhed as if it had learned her memory. Shapes peeled themselves from it, grainy, uncertain, yet familiar. Kerric’s outline moved ahead of her, not running but waiting, mouth shaping a question she had heard once in warmth: what do we ration now? The voice carried not comfort but hunger. She reached, stumbled, and her fingers closed on air colder than ice. The figure collapsed like frost under morning sun.

Another shadow stepped in, taller, broader, with no face, and it named her thief. Not in echo but in a voice dragged through stone. The stairwell beneath her answered the accusation: frost cracked, stone groaned, a subharmonic note laced the alarms. The vault had found its tongue, and it used her own guilt for its syllables.

She stopped mid-run, chest hammering, ribs still bruised from the fall. She listened. The alarms were no longer bronze mouths alone. They were conduits. The Warden did not pursue behind; it spoke here, within the clamour. Each toll was a word, each vibration a sentence, each crack in the ice a grammar designed to reach her nerves. Revelation came cold and exact: the pursuit was not a body in corridors but a presence in sound.

Her skin prickled. She understood the cost. To hear was to be found. Every breath she gave, every step she landed, was already threaded into the Warden’s litany. There would be no silence safe enough. Smoke thinned, but the truth it carried remained. She pressed on, lantern bleeding its narrow glow, with revelation heavier than fire: the enemy lived not only in flesh and frost, but in every alarm that carried her name. Revelation was not comfort. It was trap declared.

She gritted her teeth, pulled the cracked lantern tighter to her chest, and ran. Now she knew what hunted, and knowing left no room for denial.
```

**Scene 0.0.2.1:**

```
Frost snapped like bone beneath her foot. The stair shuddered, groaned, and then sagged away, a portion collapsing into blackness. She froze, arms flung to either side, lantern tilting wild arcs of light. Fragments tumbled into the hollow, chiming against stone until swallowed by depth. Time bled from her. Seconds stolen, not wounds, yet as costly.

She clung to the wall, ribs shrieking protest from bruises earned before. Cold seeped into her back. She dared not move until the tremor quieted. The alarms swelled, reverberating, feeding on her stillness. Each toll made her pulse falter. She counted three tolls, four, five—too many already. Every beat lost was another tally in the Warden’s favor.

When the stair steadied she tried again, but her pace had broken. Breath came ragged. She had wasted her own margin. Ahead the corridor still reeled with echoes. She knew the Warden pressed closer, not in body yet, but in pressure that filled her marrow. Delay had thickened into dread. She forced herself forward, slow, each step a debt unpaid.

She thought of warmth rationed beside Kerric. One spark at a time, one vow to move without pause. That vow broke now, beneath the cracking stair. Delay had breached it. She tightened her grip on the lantern. The ember still throbbed. But seconds gone are not returned. The pursuit had narrowed. She felt it in her chest, as if her heart itself were seized and measured. The vault had learned to speak, and its voice was counting her down.
```

**Scene 0.0.2.2:**

```
The Warden’s voice did not stop at her ears. It went inward, pressed heat into marrow, and forced her muscles to twitch against command. Her stride broke. She gasped, realizing the chase was no longer behind but inside her, altering rhythm of heart, pulling blood faster through veins. She clenched her jaw, yet even her teeth felt enlisted in the hunt.

Light swelled. The lantern’s fissured rim bled glow until it coated her arm, shoulder, chest. Lines of radiance traced bone, fusing her shadow into signal. Each step she took painted the wall with her outline. She tried to dim the lantern, tried to hide, but concealment was no longer hers. The ember had chosen visibility. She was half-signal, half-shield.

A brutal sentence carved through thought: she was changing. Not metaphor, not image. Changing. Flesh became conduit. Pain became seam. She stumbled against the wall, and light seared her outline onto stone, an afterimage of her refusal.

She forced herself forward. Breath tore. In the periphery she saw how frost recoiled from her, retreating before the glow. Pursuit bent closer, but so did survival. The ember had transfigured her into more than bearer. She was becoming vessel. It was unwanted, yet it was armor of a kind.

She walked, luminous and unwilling, a moving torch in corridors that fed on shadow. Each echo, each toll, each crack of frost spoke her doom. And yet, as her skin lit from within, she understood: endurance would not mean carrying the ember. It would mean becoming it.
```

**Scene 0.1.0.0:**

```
The city wall gave way with a roar. Ice cracked from its spine, shattering into an avalanche that swallowed alleys and shivered houses. She braced against the tremor, lantern jerking in her hand, light clashing with frost-glow that seeped from beneath the ruin. A chamber yawned open below, walls gleaming as if stone had learned to breathe. The collapse deafened the corridor behind; pursuit was stifled, if only for a moment.

She descended into the revealed hollow, ribs aching from strain. The air was mineral-sharp, glittering with crystals that sang against each other when disturbed. Her boots scraped, and the chamber rang like struck glass. Above, debris sealed the breach. Delay for the Warden—reprieve for her.

At the chamber’s heart the frost lit carvings, etched bones of direction. The lantern flared across them and she understood. The markings were fragments of the Ash Veins, maplines embedded in stone long before the gods withdrew. Here was not only hiding but knowledge. She touched one ridge, fingers raw, and heat surged in reply, enough to show the route forward.

She gathered shards from the fall, bone-tools carved with patterns she half-recognized. They echoed her own stitch kit, now doubled, resource renewed. Gain within ruin. Her chest swelled not with triumph but with survival’s thin relief.

Cold pressed still, danger prowled above, but she had won a moment: a path, a tool, a reprieve. Lantern light mingled with frost-glow until chamber walls gleamed like captured dawn. It was not victory. It was enough.
```

**Scene 0.1.0.1:**

```
The debris that had bought her reprieve shifted again. A moan rolled through the ruin, then a sudden crack, and the wall of ice slammed tighter. The small mouth that had let her through shrank to nothing. Above, blocks sealed over one another, freezing in place. What had spared her from pursuit now pinned her in deeper shadow.

She lunged at the barrier. Her hands struck frost, nails snapping, blood soaking into white crust that did not yield. She tore at shards, lantern dragging light that shook and scattered on smooth surfaces. Each attempt only widened her wounds. Fingers bled, wrists burned with effort. The chamber answered with silence, stone indifferent, ice unmoved.

The lantern guttered. Warmth she had clutched slipped away with every drop of blood lost into snow. Her ribs heaved, breath fogging against sealed crystal, each exhale failing to find an exit. Time fled, and warmth fled with it. The reprieve had betrayed her.

She leaned against the wall, chest burning. The ember throbbed, but its pulse was small now, hidden in the lantern’s cracked cage. Trapped deeper, she felt pursuit still echoing from beyond, yet unreachable. The loss was immediate: time spent, blood spent, warmth spent. Nothing had opened. Everything had closed.

She lowered her head against stone. Cold claimed her fingers. The ember answered faintly, but even its light seemed distant. Loss had marked its tally. And the chamber held her as if she had never left the vault at all.
```

**Scene 0.1.0.2:**

```
The bone shards fell from her grasp. Her fingers, stiff and raw, betrayed her. The stitch kit struck the floor, scattering across the frozen stone. She dropped to her knees, palms burning on ice, scrambling for each piece. Every fragment slid further than it should have, as if the frost itself conspired to keep them apart. Her breath rasped loud, heart hammering, louder still than the alarms muffled above.

She clutched at needles, gathering some, losing others. Metal kissed ice and rang sharp, mocking her haste. With every second, heat drained. She knew pursuit had not stopped. The tolls grew heavier in the stone, reverberating through marrow, urging her to move, not to crawl on frozen floor. Yet she remained crouched, wasting the margin.

She caught one shard, another, but half the kit eluded her. Numb hands failed their hold. She pressed her face to cold air and cursed with breath too thin. The lantern swung against her side, light smearing the chamber, exposing her failure in full.

The delay thickened around her. Tools half-recovered, strength frayed, warmth bleeding into stone. The Warden’s echo drew nearer with every heartbeat. She rose, staggering, kit diminished, and knew the toll had been exacted. Delay had turned into cost. Time, once hers, was gone.
```

**Scene 0.1.1.0:**

```
Kerric’s voice trembled, not from cold alone. He told her of paths once trod that he could not map again, whole cities whose names had vanished from his tongue. A sister—he remembered her face but not the syllables that bound her. Frost had stolen even the word. His breath hung between them, more absence than warmth.

Ilya listened, lantern shaking in her grasp. She understood suddenly: forgetting was not harmless. Each memory lost was as final as death. Each name dropped into silence was another ration gone, warmth slipping past their count. She felt the weight of her own past, faces hovering on the edge of recall, and feared what the frost might erase next.

He turned to her, eyes raw, and whispered that fire was not just heat. Fire was remembering. To forget was to freeze, even if the ember burned bright. The revelation cut deeper than ice: survival meant guarding names, guarding stories, with the same ferocity as guarding flame.

She pressed her forehead to the lantern glass, heat stinging her skin. The ember throbbed like a second heart. She whispered names under breath, her own litany, to keep them alive. One brutal line struck her clarity: to lose memory is to lose fire. The thought stayed, sharp as steel, heavier than the cold itself.
```

**Scene 0.1.1.1:**

```
The ember stirred within her, no longer content to be held. Heat climbed her veins, a line of fire scrawling through the wrist into the palm. She hissed and tried to release the lantern, but the cracked rim had already fused to skin. Metal branded her flesh, each hiss a letter seared, each line a syllable of fire. Pain was real, unmistakable. It made her double over, ribs taut against the flare.

She gasped, Kerric’s voice still in her ears. His words of forgotten warmth twisted now through her blood. She stared at her palm and saw it burn with patterns not drawn by her hand. Light crawled across bones. The ember had chosen shape. She could not claim to carry it any longer. It claimed her.

Her face pressed against the stone for steadiness. The frost there hissed back, melting at her touch. Skin blistered, and the brand deepened. She understood, breath clawing: bearer and ember no longer divisible. Body had become vessel. Pain welded her into the flame’s outline.

A sharp line cut through her thought: She was no longer Ilya alone. Flesh remade, marked, transformed into fire’s shell.
```

**Scene 0.1.1.2:**

```
Her branded palm rose between them, light leaking from cracks in skin. Without speaking, she pressed it toward Kerric. The glow arced across the cold, touched his wrist, and for a moment he recoiled as if struck. Then warmth pierced him. Breath steadied. The frost’s grip slackened on his hand, his face loosening from rigid pain.

The chamber brightened. Not hers alone now. The ember’s fire had passed between them, not diminished but doubled. He gripped her arm, seal of flesh against flesh, and the pact they had spoken in collapse carved itself deeper. The gain was immediate: ally renewed, strength returned, pursuit delayed by light stronger than fear.

No metaphor could hold the exchange. His frostbitten skin flushed red, blood found its path again. She felt weight lessen in her chest, burden not gone but shared. Her ribs drew fuller breath. The ember’s toll, once hers, now echoed in two bodies.

The shock of it struck like lightning—no slow revelation, no drifting. Just a surge, sharp and absolute. Pact sealed. Light no longer hers alone.
```

**Scene 0.1.2.0:**

```
The reprieve shattered. The Warden’s shadow cut through the alleys like a knife, and the walls themselves groaned, folding inward to trap them. Ilya dragged Kerric, but his legs faltered, frost racing faster than her pull. The ember flared weakly in the lantern, guttering low, its glow smothered by encroaching dark.

She shouted his name, voice breaking stone, but his breath rasped like torn cloth. Each step stole more warmth than it gave. The pact that had been sealed by blood now splintered under the cold hand of pursuit. She leaned her shoulder beneath his arm, forcing his weight along, ribs straining, but strength bled from both.

The alley narrowed until there was no space left to run. A crack rang sharp through the stones—not rescue, only collapse. Dust choked their mouths. Light dimmed. She felt the ember’s fire pulling away from her chest, smaller with each heartbeat.

She knew the loss before he slipped from her grasp. His body sagged, frost consuming his fingers first, then his breath, then his eyes. The ember dimmed with him, as though sharing his end. Pursuit closed like a lung around her. Warmth gone. Ally gone. Breath stolen.
```

**Scene 0.1.2.1:**

```
Kerric’s weight sagged heavier with each step. His legs locked, then dragged, boots carving lines into ice. She pulled with all she had, but every pace was stolen from her lungs. His breath rattled behind her, brittle, the sound of a rope fraying strand by strand. The ember’s light guttered in rhythm, flickering in time with his falter.

She counted, voice hoarse, each number cracked against frozen air. One. Two. Three. Four. Numbers meant to hold rhythm, but they wasted breath she needed. Her ribs ached, words cutting out of her throat in raw gasps. Still she counted, as if measure could keep him upright. The sound became prayer, then curse.

The Warden’s pursuit thundered nearer. Stones shook. The corridor became a drumbeat of doom. She clutched him tighter, skin burning in cold, his weight doubling as frost stiffened his joints. Frost split skin to bone, tearing his pace into silence. She dragged him, muscles breaking thread by thread, time pouring out with every useless count.

Her voice failed at last. She turned her head, saw the ember pulsing faint, nearly drowned in shadow. Behind them the echo closed. Ahead was only narrowing dark. Delay had carved its toll. Breath cut shorter. Strength wasted. The chase had not stopped, but she had spent herself stopping here.
```

**Scene 0.1.2.2:**

```
The ember flared sudden, just as she thought it was dying. Pain tore from her palm into her ribs, her scars burning bright as if etched again by fire. She staggered, breath caught, and understood with an iron jolt: the flame was not in the lantern anymore. It was in her bones.

Her knees struck ice. The lantern dangled loose, glass rattling hollow. Yet the glow pulsed beneath her skin, marrow lit with each heartbeat. She realized the pursuit was not after glass, not after an ember that could be handed off. They wanted the vessel. They wanted her body remade.

Her throat closed, but the truth was clear. Every drag of Kerric, every count, every wasted step had hidden this revelation. The ember had bound itself to her marrow, a covenant not asked but taken. Lantern could shatter; fire would remain inside her. She would burn with it until the end.

The thought stripped her bare. Pursuit thundered. Shadows closed. She rose, shaking, no lantern needed. The revelation cut simple: she was the flame. And they hunted her blood.
```

**Scene 0.2.0.0:**

```
The tunnel groaned as if it lived. Godglass veins within the stone pulsed, heating until fissures spread. Shards glowed, light spilling like molten threads against her skin. She pressed forward and the air seared her lungs. It was not the cavern alone that burned. Her body answered.

Veins lit beneath her flesh. A scream tore but did not escape, trapped behind clenched teeth. Marrow scalded raw. She staggered, slammed against the wall, and felt it flare back through her ribs. Light crawled her bones, tracing each fracture like script. Her own skeleton became lantern.

Stones split open overhead. The cavern mirrored her body: fractures glowing, veins burning, cracks spilling light. She realized with terror and clarity: she no longer held the ember. She was ember. Flesh fissured, bones etched, body sealed into fire’s shape.

The tunnel shook apart, debris raining, but she stood burning bright. Flame lived inside her marrow now, cavern and vessel the same. She was not carrying the first fire. She had become it.
```

**Scene 0.2.0.1:**

```
Her body convulsed, and the scream broke free at last. It split the tunnel, rebounded off stone, and rolled back into her chest as fuel. With that cry the ember’s heat drove her muscles beyond limit. She surged forward, stride ignited by fire that was no longer separate but marrow-born.

Her legs did not falter now. Every vein burned, each pulse throwing strength through sinew. Pain did not vanish—it sharpened—but pain became propulsion. The tunnel’s collapse behind her sounded like pursuit falling short. She felt her ribs expand, breath tearing but full, her stride lengthening until shadow fell back.

The Warden’s echo staggered. Even its relentless chase paused at the shock of her sudden pace. She felt distance open—scarce but real. The ember had given her not mercy but power. It poured raw into muscle, granting her a gain that seared as it saved.

She did not thank it. She only ran, faster than she thought her body could. Fire bit her bones, but each bite gave speed. For this moment, she was not prey. She was pace itself, and pursuit faltered.
```

**Scene 0.2.0.2:**

```
The fire within her surged until her bones rattled, then caught on nothing, stalling like a wheel in sand. She staggered. Her chest heaved, throat raw. Her breath tasted of iron, metallic, each inhale a wound. She tried to force her stride longer, but flame weighed her down, dragging inside her ribs.

She pressed forward. Legs shook, heat spilled into knees, but the ember’s strength would not rise in rhythm. It smoldered, too heavy to wield with speed. Her lungs clawed for air, each gasp cutting shorter, stride broken into uneven fragments. The corridor shook with pursuit growing closer, footfalls hammering like a closing gate.

Her hand scraped stone, sparks catching against skin, but she found no purchase. The body that had just become ember faltered beneath its own burden. Delay stretched, heavy as frost on breath. Time spilled out useless, burned away without moving her forward.

Behind her the Warden’s echo grew louder. Ahead the path narrowed. She had no choice but to spend seconds, precious and wasting, on one more failed gasp. Fire lived in her marrow, but in that moment it pinned her still.
```

**Scene 0.2.1.0:**

```
The cavern closed on her. Walls flared with glasslike polish, and in them faces burned—her own, over and over, each fracture repeating her features lit with fire. She stepped closer, breath tight. The nearest face leaned back with her, but its eyes burned alive. It did not mirror. It declared.

Revelation struck her ribs like hammer. These were not reflections. They were futures. Each shard showed a body already rewritten, fire laced through its veins, mouth open with light. She had thought she carried the ember, but here the ember had written her. Identity stripped and rewritten. Vessel, not bearer. There was no return.

Her body a furnace choking on its own ash. She felt it with every step. Fire pressed out, re-shaping her frame until she knew the truth with bone-deep clarity: she would never be whole again, only burning. The faces confirmed it, each showing another version walking deeper into flame.

She reached to touch the glass, but the shard seared her palm. Skin smoked. She pulled back, the fire inside answering, burning brighter. She understood then: the ember had chosen, and it had chosen her as its shape. The path was already inscribed. Ahead lay only fire.
```

**Scene 0.2.1.1:**

```
She called out to the mirrored faces, voice cracked raw, hoping for answer. But silence pressed in, thick and unmoved. No echo, no return. Her words hung dead in the cavern air, as if swallowed before they were born.

Something slipped. A memory she had kept close, a name she once whispered to herself against the cold, vanished. She reached for it, found nothing. Empty. The ember inside her seared hotter, and she knew the fire had taken it, devoured what she was trying to preserve. A hollow opened, and she was smaller for it.

Her breath shuddered. The glasslike walls showed her image burning, but now without the memory that once held her upright. She clenched her fists, nails cutting skin, but even pain could not bring it back. The ember was not only remaking her body. It was eating her mind.

Loss left her staggered. No wound visible, but worse than any gash. Silence sealed the chamber, the memory gone forever. She walked forward, emptier, fire heavier in her chest.
```

**Scene 0.2.1.2:**

```
It came like a lightning bolt through bone. Her spine cracked with the strike, ribs flared wide as if torn apart by unseen hands. Fire leapt outward, not lantern-light but marrow erupting, her body breaking open fast. She collapsed, palms scraping stone, breath ripped to shreds.

Her knees buckled as if frost struck her marrow. Pain raced like iron through her veins. Then heat devoured it, drowning every nerve until nothing remained but flame’s command. She gasped, but the sound was not air—it was fire hissing through her teeth. She was no longer carrier. She was fire-wrapped flesh.

Her outline blurred, skin shining with a molten sheen. Shadows that chased her faltered. The Warden slowed, no longer certain of prey. They saw not a woman fleeing, but a figure burning, ungraspable, impossible to claim. In that sudden moment pursuit lost its anchor.

The cavern’s mirrored faces no longer reflected her—they shattered into light, unable to hold the new shape. What stood in their place was something uncontained, marrow burned clean of doubt. She staggered upright, flesh crackling, every step a flare of her new self. Pursuit could not close in. She had been rewritten by fire.
```

**Scene 0.2.2.0:**

```
The blaze within her no longer flared wild. It settled. Flame sank deeper into marrow until it pulsed in rhythm with her heart. Heat steadied into a core, hearthlike, radiating strength without burning her hollow. She drew breath, and each inhale seemed to feed it. Her body no longer cracked open under fire’s whip. It carried her, held her upright.

Her stride evened. Muscles that had faltered found warmth instead of pain. Step by step she regained ground, feet certain, balance no longer stolen by the ember’s surges. She was fueled, not consumed. Her palms no longer trembled when they brushed the stone. Each touch returned sure, each breath filled and steady.

The tunnel behind still echoed with pursuit, but she felt the space widen. She gained ground not by frantic rush, but by pace sustained. Her flame was no longer only burden. It had given her something to hold.

She ran, and with every step the ember’s power moved not against her, but with her. Gain made solid, fire banked inside her chest. For the first time she felt the ember as companion, not curse.
```

**Scene 0.2.2.1:**

```
Her breath hitched. A step broken. The stride that had steadied faltered mid-run, knees dragging heavy as stone. Heat inside her chest slackened, the ember answering slow, too slow. For a moment fire did not come when called.

Delay carved itself into her body. Muscles burned but gave no speed. She gasped and tried to push, yet her legs dragged. The ground she had won slipped away, second by second. Behind, the Warden’s echo returned, closer, sharper.

Her arms flailed once for balance, nails scraping against the wall’s glasslike face. Sparks flashed, died. The ember throbbed but would not leap. Breath came ragged, time lost with every inhale that gave no strength. Pursuit filled the silence with its thunder.

Seconds wasted, irreplaceable. She stumbled again, body pulled by gravity more than flame. The corridor shortened around her. The delay was real, and it was cost. It would not last.
```

**Scene 0.2.2.2:**

```
The echoes of pursuit softened, boots no longer crashing so near. For a heartbeat she believed she had widened the gap. But then the cavern itself answered with a new sound—low, steady, like lungs pulling cold metal through the air. She froze. It was pursuit, yet it was also her.

Revelation struck sharp, unbearable. The breath she heard in the stone matched her own cadence. Doubled. The hunter’s breath was hers. The ember within did not only burn her body—it followed, mirrored, pressed her from behind and from within.

She heard its breath, cold metal dragging through air. The truth seared: fire was no separate force, no burden carried. It was the pursuit itself, hounding her, reshaping her, consuming her. Her hunter was her marrow. Her marrow was her enemy. She could not run from it because she was running with it, carrying it closer with every step.

Clarity flared too bright to bear, and she staggered under its weight, knowing she could not be both bearer and prey without paying the price. Fire had given her distance, but also closed the last escape. She carried not just hope but the chase itself.
```

**Scene 1.0.0.0:**

```
The docks creaked under salted wind, timbers swollen with years of brine. Smoke drifted from small barter fires, each flame weak, bargaining warmth against the cold breath of the sea. Ilya stepped among them, ember sealed close, yet its glow lit her throat when she spoke.

The companions emerged from shadow. A sailor with hands cracked like nets, a scribe carrying bones etched with vanished names, a thief clutching torn maps of veins and coasts. Each carried debt, and each knew it. They did not follow her out of faith. They came because of what they owed, or what they hoped to take.

When she spoke, the ember pulsed. Their eyes answered, catching a faint spark, as if the fire chose to mark them at first meeting. Their breath shivered with sudden heat, then steadied. They did not step back. They understood. Oath had already altered them.

The docks groaned, brittle beneath their weight, as if the world itself acknowledged the bargain. The fellowship was born not from trust, but from fire’s demand. Transformation widened: not only Ilya, but all who stood with her carried ember’s touch. Cost was declared before the journey even began.
```

**Scene 1.0.0.1:**

```
The scribe faltered first. Frost had crept into his lungs, brittle with each inhale, and his steps slowed until the group realized he could not keep pace. He clutched his bones, the etched names rattling faintly, but his grip loosened. Debt remained unpaid.

They tried to lift him. The sailor pressed shoulders against his weight, Ilya reached with burning hand, but the ember recoiled. Heat flared too near his chest, and he gasped blood into the salt air. The thief of maps swore, tearing his half-map in frustration, but paper fell in tatters. The scribe sagged to the ground.

They looked at her, and each saw the ember in the other’s face. Then silence claimed him. No word marked his passing, only the crack of ice at dock’s edge. The fellowship was reduced, not by choice but by cold’s hand. The circle bent open, a shape with one side missing.

Ilya felt the gap more sharply than any wound. The ember within her burned heavier, weighted by the absence it could not fill. Step resumed, but uneven. The fellowship walked forward, and behind them the scribe lay still, map torn, voice lost to frost.
```

**Scene 1.0.0.2:**

```
The thief spoke with reluctant hands. From beneath his coat he drew a folded shard of parchment, edges brittle with salt. He opened it against the firelight, and the lines revealed themselves—fragments of the Ash Veins, branching toward the salted sea. The others leaned close, salt air cutting their throats, but hope returned with the map’s faint lines.

They marked the route together. The sailor traced the coastline, the scribe—still coughing from frost—nodded with the recognition of landmarks. For once they saw more than debts; they saw a path. The fellowship, bent by loss, closed again around this gain.

The ember pulsed in Ilya’s chest. Its flare spread into her arms, warming her companions as if acknowledging the offering. Each felt it briefly: fingers unclenched, breath no longer torn. It was a shared warmth, a gift as fleeting as bubbles on the tide.

The thief’s eyes darted, calculating still, but the map was theirs, and the path was clear. For a moment, unity did not feel like burden. It felt like direction. It felt like gain. The ember agreed, and its glow steadied them through the salted dark.
```

**Scene 1.0.1.0:**

```
The cough deepened until it became a rhythm, dragging the group into stops they could not afford. Each pause lengthened. Breath hissed through his chest, rough as salt dragged over stone. Cold seeped into their bones with every delay.

They tried to bear his weight. The sailor slung him over one shoulder, knees buckling under the effort. The thief pressed a hand to steady him, though his eyes darted toward the horizon, measuring how much ground was lost. The ember flickered weak in Ilya’s chest, warmth rationed thin as if withholding until they moved again.

Their steps grew uneven. The path was no longer a march but a stumble, stretched between halts. Silence broke only by the cough and the echo of pursuit. Louder. Nearer. Every delay carried cost. The Warden’s footsteps did not hurry; they did not need to. Time itself betrayed them.

Delay stole distance, and the fellowship felt it with every dragging step. The cold grew heavier, the ember dimmer. Still they moved, slower, slower, each breath sounding like a clock striking against their chests, counting down what little distance remained.
```

**Scene 1.0.1.1:**

```
The ember flared without warning. Light cracked through the scribe’s ribs, his cough cut short by a cry that struck the cavern like metal rung. They staggered back as his chest glowed, a furnace hammered inside fragile bone.

He convulsed, breath drawn not in air but in shards of sound. The voice that left his mouth was no longer breath—it rang sharp, like glass struck with iron. The sickness was gone, swept out by fire, but in its place stood something altered. His eyes burned with inner flame, no longer dulled by frost.

The fellowship recoiled. The sailor cursed, the thief reached for his knife. Ilya alone held her ground, the ember in her chest answering the flare in his. She saw the debt erased and rewritten in the same instant. He would no longer falter, but the man who had coughed was gone.

They had carried his weight like an anchor dragged across ice. Now he walked on his own, light spilling from beneath his skin, his voice no longer his own. The ember had spared him by remaking him, and the fellowship felt the cost: sickness lifted, but something human burned away.
```

**Scene 1.0.1.2:**

```
The ember pulsed hotter as they pressed on, light spilling into stone corridors that bent like veins. Ilya felt it in her chest, but now she saw it also in the air ahead. The glow cast paths clear as lines of a map, and each turn seemed to welcome them. The fellowship followed with brittle trust, thinking the way revealed.

Then the echoes shifted. Footsteps behind fell into perfect rhythm with the light before. Ilya heard the Warden’s tread and realized it did not seek—it was guided. The same fire that marked their path also lit his. The ember had not been compass for them alone; it was beacon, shining to predator as to bearer.

The revelation struck her like ice in marrow. She saw every advantage inverted. Their gain was his gain. Their hope was his guide. Fire had never been only hers—it belonged equally to the pursuit. She knew then the ember would not only burn her; it would consume them all.

The fellowship marched slower after that. Each step forward felt like dragging the Warden with them, tied by light they could not extinguish. The candle’s glow was revelation, and it betrayed as much as it promised.
```

**Scene 1.0.2.0:**

```
The sailor’s shout startled them. From beneath the rubble of a toppled storehouse he dragged a bundle, scales clattering, fish stiff with frost. His grin cracked salt from his lips. The find was not feast, but it was sustenance, and for a moment hunger loosened its hold.

They built a small fire, smoke curling dark against the pale ruin. The flesh cooked brittle, but the smell made their jaws ache with longing. They ate, hands shaking, and the ember in Ilya’s chest steadied with each swallow. Warmth spread through their veins, not full but enough to remind them of life.

Joy was sharp and brief. The smoke’s trail stretched high, staining sky and wind. The thief froze first, hearing the distant shift of hounds. Even while chewing, they knew. Nourishment was beacon. Every gain held ash inside it. The Warden would see the column of black rising.

Ilya swallowed hard. Strength returned, yes, but so did peril. They had fed themselves, and in the same breath, fed their pursuit.
```

**Scene 1.0.2.1:**

```
The fog came while they ate. At first it seemed a blessing, swallowing the smoke before it could mark the sky. But soon it thickened, swallowing the path itself. Shapes dissolved. Footsteps doubled back on themselves. The ember in Ilya’s chest glowed dim, its light smothered gray.

They called to one another. Voices muffled, direction blurred. The sailor’s laugh, so sharp when he found the fish, became a curse lost in vapor. One figure turned wrong, and when the fog thinned, that place was empty. No body, no trace—just the hush of mist closing again.

Strength had returned with food, but absence undid it. Each step forward dragged with the weight of the missing. Ilya felt the ember heavier, its warmth less a promise than a debt unpaid. The fellowship was thinner now, not by ice or blade, but by the veiling of the world itself. Loss without witness, loss without sound, only fog where once there was a face.
```

**Scene 1.0.2.2:**

```
Fog thickened again, heavier than before, as if the world itself wished to stall them. They halted often, breath shallow, each pause longer than the last. The ember glowed faintly in Ilya’s chest, warmth measured out like crumbs, minute by minute.

The fellowship huddled close, movements slowed. Every step forward faltered into waiting. Cold seeped deeper. Time slipped past them like sand, though the hourglass never turned. Their gain from food and fire withered in the drag of inaction.

Behind them, silence carried weight. The Warden’s approach was not heard but felt, the pressure of its presence swelling closer. Each pause was not just delay; it was invitation. They knew it but still could not move faster. The fog commanded stillness.

The chase lengthened its shadow with every wasted breath. Delay thickened the air, turned lungs to stone, and stripped the fellowship of the little ground they had gained.
```

**Scene 1.1.0.0:**

```
The betrayal was not hidden long. Ilya caught the glint of the map as it was passed, silver scratches of the Ash Veins exposed in the trader’s grasp. Her hand closed on the traitor’s wrist, ember flaring from her chest into her palm. The heat seared through flesh, a brand carved in fire. He screamed, voice cut ragged, and the smell of scorched skin curled into the night air.

She did not release him. She forced his hand open, pressed until the ember’s light etched a scar across his palm. When she finally let go, the mark glowed red, a wound shaped like loyalty though born of pain. The map clattered to the ground between them, no longer his to barter.

The fellowship watched, horror mingled with grim relief. The betrayer staggered, clutching his branded hand. His oath was renewed, not by choice but by fire. He would walk with them, unwilling guide marked by the ember’s authority.

Trust was gone. The fellowship was altered, fused not by belief but by scar. What was burned could not be undone. Their path bent with this transformation, and every step forward would carry the weight of his branded flesh, the smell of betrayal turned into obedience.
```

**Scene 1.1.0.1:**

```
The brand did more than sear. When the betrayer opened his mouth again, his voice rang hollow, not his own but edged with a strange resonance, a shimmer of light threading each syllable. The fellowship froze. His oath came not in words chosen but in sounds bent through the ember’s fire.

Ilya’s chest ached. She had thought only to mark him, to bind his hand, but the ember had carved deeper, lacing its heat through his voice. What spoke now was obedience, stripped bare of will. His eyes flinched at every word, as if hearing himself as stranger.

The companions drew back. This was not loyalty reforged; it was will erased, speech enslaved. They understood then that the ember’s brand was no scar but a fissure. Through it the fire leaked, claiming tongue and breath as its own.

Silence followed, thicker than any fog. They stared at him, and then at Ilya, and saw not discipline gained but freedom gone. Revelation weighed heavier than the ember itself: the fire did not only burn flesh—it spoke, and it spoke through them.
```

**Scene 1.1.0.2:**

```
The coin fell from the betrayer’s cloak as he staggered. Ilya stooped and held it to the ember’s glow. Bronze dulled by years, yet its seal shone clear: a city long fallen, its crest etched deep. Around the rim, faint lines traced a path, not ornament but route, a secret carried in metal.

The companions leaned closer. For all the loss, for all the fracture, here was direction. Shelter whispered in grooves of a forgotten mint. The ember’s fire gleamed across its face, revealing roads unseen on any parchment. They gained more than coin—they gained a map written in alloy and shadow.

But the air shifted, uneasy. Fortune’s glint cut sharp. The coin’s knowledge was not free. To follow its path meant binding themselves tighter to the ember, and to the fate it carried. The Warden would hunt not only the flame but now the trail it illuminated.

Still, hands closed around the coin, clutching the seal of a lost city. Gain undeniable. Destiny narrowed, sharpened, seared into their grasp like metal just lifted from the forge.
```

**Scene 1.1.1.0:**

```
The frost came sharper than any blade. Their rations were gone, breath hanging thick in the brittle air. Each inhale hollowed their chests, and even the ember’s warmth felt thin, a frail thread against the cold. Snow crusted over boots, slowing steps, dragging time.

One companion faltered. His hands, blackened by frostbite, dropped the tools he had carried. They fell uselessly into the snow, iron ringing once, then silent. He sank beside them, breath a pale ghost leaking from lips already gray. None could lift him. The ember burned in Ilya’s ribs, but its light did not reach him.

They pressed forward, fewer now, the gap in their ranks raw and jagged. When they tried to unroll the maps, parchment cracked, edges splintering into fragments. Knowledge stiffened, broke, and scattered on the wind. The path they carried thinned as surely as their number.

The ember’s glow seemed heavier, its burden grown by the loss. It seared against Ilya’s chest, not warmer but weightier, as if demanding more with each life it outlasted.
```

**Scene 1.1.1.1:**

```
They stopped in the snow, the one whose hands had blackened cradled close. With the bone-needle kit they worked slowly, fumbling, each stitch in torn cloth an eternity. Breath rattled in their chests. The ember gave little light, flickering weak as if unwilling to spend itself on waiting.

Food was measured out in crumbs. Each hour stretched, thin as glass. The fellowship lingered too long. Silence gathered, broken only by muffled gasps and the scrape of needle against stiffened cloth. Every moment delayed them, every pause another thread pulled loose from their chance.

Behind, the world seemed to listen. A pressure rose, unseen but drawing nearer. The Warden’s steps were not heard, yet the air thickened as if announcing its approach. Time lost could not be reclaimed, and their care—gentle, necessary—was also their ruin.

When they rose again, the ember felt dimmer, its glow pale in Ilya’s chest. Delay had written itself into their bones. They moved forward knowing the hunt was closer, the frost deeper, and that their compassion had cost them ground they would never regain.
```

**Scene 1.1.1.2:**

```
The maps broke in her hands, parchment splintering into powder. Snow lifted the shards, carried them away, leaving lines unreadable. Ilya did not flinch. She bent low, thrusting the fragments toward the ember. It hissed and flared, light devouring ink, ash curling upward. The scent was sharp, bitter as burnt vellum.

She pressed the smoke into herself. Heat raced across her skin, searing veins as if rewriting them. Lines drew themselves under her flesh, black-red tracery branching down her arms, across her throat. She gasped, lips cracked by cold, tasting metal where a thread had cut. Memory was no longer parchment; it was scar, fire-drawn and living.

The fellowship staggered back. They saw their guide remade, maps burned from page into body. No one else could hold the path now. The ember had carved knowledge straight into her blood. They would follow her because nothing else remained.

When she rose, her eyes burned with roads. The snow could not erase them. The Warden could not seize them. But the fellowship knew the price: their leader had become both map and burden, a body branded into direction. The path forward was etched in her skin, unerasable, searing with every step.
```

**Scene 1.1.2.0:**

```
The ember did not stop at skin. It burned deeper, its weight lodging in her chest, and when she spoke her voice fractured into rhythms of counting. Each phrase broke into tally marks, each pause a sum carried forward. The companions listened, unease crawling. No prophecy remained in her tongue, only arithmetic stripped bare of omen.

They shivered. Their guide was no longer the dream of gods, no oracle of fire; she had become ledger, her body speaking in numbers. Distances laid out like debts, rations divided into fractions, survival reduced to subtraction. Myth was ash. The ember had translated faith into calculation.

One companion covered his ears but still heard the counting, as though the ember had set the air itself to reckon. The fellowship felt chilled, not by wind but by the revelation that only arithmetic remained to lead them. They followed nonetheless, because numbers, cruel as they were, at least did not lie. Yet each step felt less like journey and more like equation solving itself to its end.
```

**Scene 1.1.2.1:**

```
Her counting changed. Where once it drained hope, now the sums bent toward a place beneath snow. She spoke a ruin into being, each number sharpening its outline until companions felt it underfoot. They dug, hands raw, until stone rang.

The ruin opened, bitter air rushing, but within: metal still sharp, dried grain sealed in clay, embershards faintly glimmering. Their breaths came quick, the first reprieve in long days. Hunger slackened, shoulders eased. They held tools that would last longer than bone, food that would outlast frost.

Yet the gain bound them. The ruin’s yield came because of her voice, her ember-driven arithmetic. They knew now that every path forward, every resource, came through her flame. Relief was edged with the iron tether of dependence.

They left the ruin not lighter but bound tighter, their fortune chained to the ember’s sums. Her voice ticked like a clock of frost, each syllable both sustenance and shackle.
```

**Scene 1.1.2.2:**

```
Fog unfurled without warning, a gray veil lowering between trees and ruin-stones. The ember’s glow dulled, smeared across the air until it looked less like fire than faint smear of smoke. They followed her voice, but even that faltered, numbers swallowed, sums tangled on the tongue. Every step repeated the last.

They circled the same ridge thrice. Footprints overlapped, hollowed deeper with each pass. A companion swore, voice muffled as if pressed into cloth. The world shrank to a ring of frost and breath, and no measure could break it. Arithmetic became uncertain, chalk smudged by damp.

Patience thinned. Suspicion rose again, old fractures aching open. Was she guiding them or stalling? Was the ember leading or deceiving? The fog offered no answer. Only delay, hour after hour, progress stolen into haze.

And beyond the curtain, something moved closer. The air carried weight, a silence laced with intent. Though unseen, they felt the Warden closing the distance, one stride gained for every circle they traced. Delay was not absence—it was pursuit tightening its coil.
```

**Scene 1.2.0.0:**

```
The ember convulsed, a flare surging from her chest. Ribs snapped like glass under strain. The crack echoed, sharper than wind. She gasped, fell to her knees, breath torn into steam. A companion lunged to steady her.

Flame leapt instead, searing him from shoulder to heart. His eyes widened, no scream left his throat. Smoke curled out of him like a wick burned dry. He collapsed without farewell. Snow closed over his body as if nothing had been there at all.

The ember’s light dimmed again, its flare brief, its gift cruel. The fellowship shrank once more, silence pressing heavy around them. They moved on without words, thinner than before, each step dragging absence with it. The loss hollowed them, no time to mourn, only the burn of cold and the memory of sudden fire.
```

**Scene 1.2.0.1:**

```
The ember did not devour her this time. It erupted, reshaping her, bones twisting into strength that did not belong to flesh. Fire coursed through her veins, reforging them as rivets of light. The companion who had reached for her fell back burned, but she remained upright, her chest blazing with unnatural symmetry. She was not undone—she was remade.

The fellowship staggered away from her. Where once they had walked beside a woman, now they looked upon a vessel of flame. Her breath came in harsh chords, her gaze haloed by burning fissures. The ember had spared its bearer but branded her, carved her into a shape that could hold its hunger.

Silence bound them. No one dared touch her. Awe and fear braided into obedience, a submission not asked but taken. Their leader was fire-bound, no longer wholly human, and that truth bent their steps. What had been choice became compulsion, their path narrowed under the law of flame. Ilya felt it too: her body no longer her own, but the ember’s vessel, the ember’s will, the ember’s burden. Transformation left no room to turn back.
```

**Scene 1.2.0.2:**

```
The silence after his fall was more brutal than the crack of ribs or the rush of fire. They looked to her, not with hope but with fear sharpened into clarity. The ember had not spared her by accident—it had chosen. Its surge consumed others so that she might endure. She stood unscathed while ash drifted where a companion had been.

One voice whispered the truth aloud: the fire would feed on them to preserve her. The fellowship froze, each hearing what they already knew. Cold recognition cut deeper than wind. Their survival was no longer shared. It hung only on her endurance, on the flame she bore, ruthless in its selection.

Ilya felt the truth strike her as hard as the frost. She was not leader by courage, nor guide by will. She was vessel, and the vessel remained by the fire’s demand. Each step forward was not earned but bought in others’ bodies. Revelation rang cold as iron, and no one spoke again as they moved on, their silence a consent they could not refuse.
```

**Scene 1.2.1.0:**

```
Snow fell so heavily it seemed the sky had shattered and decided to bury them. The trail disappeared behind each step, erased as soon as pressed. Progress collapsed into a blur of wasted hours, a motion that felt like standing still. Wind keened through their bones, a sound that spoke of futility. The ember glowed, but dimmer, its light consumed by storm.

They stumbled. Some counted steps, others breaths, but numbers failed them; each sum drowned in white. Minutes fled unnoticed, stretched thin until they became weight upon their shoulders. Delay thickened the air, made it harder to move, harder even to think. They moved as if dragged backward, every gain swallowed before it formed.

No one spoke of the Warden, yet all knew the storm bought it time. Each wasted hour was its inheritance. Its silence grew heavier, closer, a shadow lengthening just out of sight. Delay was no pause—it was a trap closing, slow as frost yet certain as death.
```

**Scene 1.2.1.1:**

```
They stumbled in drift until one foot struck iron. A buried hatch yielded to their weight, groaning open. Inside the ruin, coal lay in heaps, black and dry, sealed away from storm. They fell upon it as starving men upon bread, feeding the cracked lantern, feeding their palms, their lungs, their will. Fire crackled, sharp, real, not ember-born but earth’s old fuel. Heat bled back into their fingers, and for a breath the fellowship remembered living.

Laughter broke the silence, harsh and brief but human. They warmed, stretched stiff limbs, counted fewer losses. The ember dimmed in their minds for an instant, as if displaced by common flame. Yet with smoke rose danger. It curled out through vents, a black script written across the white air. Skyward it climbed, a beacon no storm could erase. Even in warmth, dread quickened: their gain would draw eyes.

Ilya watched the fire and knew it bought them hours, nothing more. The coal’s reprieve was sharp, welcome, and costly. Somewhere beyond the horizon the Warden would see the plume and move closer. The fellowship sat in the glow, warmed, renewed, and marked for the hunt.
```

**Scene 1.2.1.2:**

```
The storm pressed them still, each step swallowed by drifts, each breath a weight. Then light seeped through Ilya’s skin. For a moment her veins glowed like thin wicks, fire guttering in glass. The fellowship halted. She was remade again, but not wholly, not with permanence. The ember pushed outward, showing them what she might become, then dimmed, leaving her shaking.

Fear hushed them. Reverence too. They saw her as vessel, yet fragile, flickering. Human enough to collapse, inhuman enough to blaze. Their pause stretched longer than the storm itself. In awe they forgot the Warden’s silence, forgot the cost of stillness.

Her body held neither victory nor ruin but an uncertain shaping. Transformation had come and gone like a candle’s flame in wind. What remained was delay, precious and perilous—the path stalled, the fellowship staring, bound by a change too sudden to trust.
```

**Scene 1.2.2.0:**

```
The storm calmed by dawn, yet they had grown fewer. One of the men had lain down against the drift in the night and never risen again. His breath had ebbed without sound, without struggle, as if frost had simply chosen him. They found him stiff, his face sealed by white crust, his eyelids locked shut. No word was spoken. They did not lift him. They did not burn him. They walked on.

The ember glowed faintly in Ilya’s chest, but none would meet her eyes. Silence hung like frost between them. They moved lighter, yes, but not stronger, as though they had rehearsed this loss before and would rehearse it again. Grief was no longer argued, no longer allowed a cry—it was swallowed whole. Each companion knew the cold had won one more measure, and they had given it willingly by failing to resist.

She pressed forward, carrying both ember and absence. The fellowship thinned. The silence deepened. And the road lengthened into a tally of bodies that no one dared count aloud.
```

**Scene 1.2.2.1:**

```
They stood over him but could not bury him. The ground was locked, iron-hard, resisting their picks, their knives, their bare hands. Hours slipped while they tried, while frost hardened around the body. Delay bound them more surely than chains. Time itself grew hostile, weighing down their muscles, turning each motion to futility. No cry rose.

They lingered too long. Breath clouded into heavy curtains. The corpse stayed where it fell, stiff, white-dusted, unyielding. Their circle grew colder by the hour, the ember paling in her chest. Silence stretched until it felt endless, a fog they could not step out of. The longer they stood, the thinner their hope became.

And beyond the curtain of snow something stirred, patient as stone. The Warden moved closer, its silence gifted by their wasted hours. Delay had not spared them grief, nor bought them rest. It had only made them still enough for the hunter to find them.
```

**Scene 1.2.2.2:**

```
The body was left behind. They pressed on until a pouch, half-buried in the drift, snagged beneath a boot. Fingers pried it open, and salt stung the air. Meat, dried and kept from thaw, unspoiled. The fellowship stared as though at a miracle. Hands shook as they tore strips free, chewing, swallowing, the silence broken at last by the wet crack of teeth.

Strength ran back into them like thaw into rivers. Shoulders lifted, legs steadied, eyes no longer dulled. Even their voices returned, brittle jokes, curses spat like proof of life. Ilya felt the ember flare in answer, but for once it was not alone. Hunger quieted, briefly, by earth’s preserved gift.

Yet as they chewed, each tasted memory more than meat: the ration lines of their childhoods, the hollow nights that carved them thin. Sustenance filled their bellies, but hope did not follow. What they had gained was survival, nothing further. Still, survival was enough, and for a moment, it was plenty.
```

**Scene 2.0.0.0:**

```
The husk of the dead sun loomed above, black stone against starless vault, its face sheer and infinite. Ilya set her hand to it. Frost split her skin, yet beneath it heat rose, and each drop of blood hissed against the surface. Her ascent began not as climb but as sacrifice, every hold taken with burning palms, every step an offering. The stone devoured her flesh and returned flame in its place.

Her fingers changed first. Nails peeled away, leaving ember-bright shards where keratin had been. Light crawled under her skin, ribs aglow, each exhale a plume of smoke. The climb offered no retreat. Muscles tore and knit anew, fibers shot through with fire. Flesh thinned, became translucent, veins like glass filaments threaded with light. Blood warmed like struck iron. She was no longer wholly mortal.

The fellowship watched but did not follow. Some tried; most failed. The path rejected them. Their breaths stilled against the wall’s indifference. One by one they let go. Ilya alone remained, her body consumed yet sustained, every inch higher binding her more tightly to the ember. She climbed into transformation, becoming what none else could: flame given form, body yielding, soul smelted to fire’s demand.
```

**Scene 2.0.0.1:**

```
Her breaths shortened until they seemed to burn her throat; her ribs glowed like molten bars inside her chest. Each exhale steamed into the black, but within that haze another sight opened. The ember was not a gift. It was hunger bound in light, a parasite clinging to her marrow, eating in order to remain. What she carried was no promise of dawn but a mouth that refused to close.

She staggered. In that moment the stone around her blurred into visions—figures bent beneath the same fire. Faces hollowed, bodies caved from within, each one bearing the ember until it emptied them. No rebirth, no reignition, only a chain of vessels scorched to ash. They had climbed, as she climbed, and all were unmade.

The revelation struck with silence sharper than a scream. The ember would not save the sun; it had never meant to. It would only live by consuming her, as it had consumed them. She was not heir to hope. She was fuel, and the climb itself was its feeding ground.
```

**Scene 2.0.0.2:**

```
The climb became narrower. Frosted stone flaked beneath their weight, each handhold a wound waiting to open. Then one companion slipped. The sound was brief, a scrape of boot, a rush of breath. No cry followed. The body fell into black and was gone.

There was no rope to throw. No hand stretched after. They stood still only long enough to register the absence, then turned upward again. Grief froze hard and fast, brittle as the wall itself. Endurance took its place, blank and cold.

Lighter by one, they rose. Death folded into ascent, loss tucked against silence. Each step wrote it deeper into their marrow, but no word marked it. The mountain of the sun swallowed the companion, and the climb demanded they continue.
```

**Scene 2.0.1.0:**

```
One companion froze on the ledge. His hands locked around the rock, eyes staring wide, body rigid as if frost had entered the marrow. He would not move. He would not rise. Fear and cold bound him in place.

The others gathered, begged him forward, promised warmth and rest. They wasted their breath. Frost thickened across their lips, snow biting deeper into their fingers. Hours slid past like stones down an unseen slope. The climb did not resume. The husk above remained unmoved.

Minutes calcified into hours. The line held still, every body caught in his refusal. Their strength leaked away into air. Delay became their cage, a prison without walls, and the silence of the waiting mountain pressed down heavier than any weight of stone.
```

**Scene 2.0.1.1:**

```
They tried to draw him upward. Voices frayed against his silence. He did not move. His breath shuddered, his gaze fixed high above. Then, in a voice ragged but clear, he said he had seen the summit alight. Not with dawn. With ruin.

He spoke of a fire that swallowed sky, a blaze that would not save but consume. The ember in Ilya’s chest, he said, was no seed of rebirth but of ending. Its glow was the same he glimpsed on the peak, devouring all. His refusal was not cowardice but conviction. To climb was to feed that fire.

The fellowship stilled. Doubt cut through them sharper than wind. What had been delay became fracture, each heart splintered between faith and fear. Ilya felt the ember press harder in her ribs, as if it knew it had been named. Hope did not vanish, but it burned crooked, tethered to doom.
```

**Scene 2.0.1.2:**

```
The delay ended not with progress but with change. Ilya’s body flared against the mountain’s silence. Her eyes caught fire first, irises splitting into molten shards that burned from within. When she exhaled, her breath left as flame, curling against the stone. The companions recoiled. In her profile they saw not a bearer of light but light itself, terrible, unbound.

Her veins pulsed visibly under skin thinned by ascent, each line bright as a filament drawn to breaking. Words caught in her throat and left as sparks. She no longer seemed mortal. Half of her was ember, the other half ash awaiting collapse. The mountain no longer resisted her. It absorbed her steps as if she belonged to it, as if she were fire climbing fire.

No one spoke. They pressed back from her heat. The fellowship had already thinned; now trust burned away too. In her chest the ember beat not like a burden but like a second heart. And with each beat she became less the woman who had carried it and more the flame itself, incarnate and inevitable.
```

**Scene 2.0.2.0:**

```
The ember surged through her veins like molten current, knitting torn muscles with fire’s hand. Pain, which had been constant, dropped away as if cut loose. In its place came a sharp, intoxicating force. Every reach carried her farther. Every grip sank deeper. She scaled the stone with speed that frightened even herself.

Her palms smoked against the wall, melting frost, leaving prints of seared rock. The husk of the dead sun did not resist. It yielded, softened, as if it recognized its own heat within her. Each motion struck like lightning. The mountain seemed less obstacle than extension of her transformed body.

Behind her, companions faltered. Their breaths hitched not from cold but from the sight of her. They saw power not borrowed but possessed, as if the ember had claimed her fully. Fear mingled with awe. She climbed without falter, marrow a furnace, skin a veil thinning, her form more fire than flesh. In that moment, gain was hers: strength unearned, blinding, but temporary as a spark against night.
```

**Scene 2.0.2.1:**

```
Her climb seared a trail into the husk. One companion reached for it, trying to follow, and his palm met her molten handhold. Flesh burned. He wrenched back too late, skin ruined, fingers useless. His cry tore the thin air, echoing like a crack across stone.

The ember gave her strength, but it demanded his. He slipped, could not clutch with ruined hands, and fell into the gulf below. His scream ended in a void without answer. Only silence remained, colder than before.

Ilya climbed on. She did not look down. Gain had given her speed, but it was weighted with another absence. Fire fed itself on flesh, and the ascent exacted its toll in lives. The husk accepted both—the burning ascent and the body swallowed into dark.
```

**Scene 2.0.2.2:**

```
Her stride broke the rhythm of the climb. She pulled ahead, fire lacing her veins, while the others shrank back from her heat. Their breaths stuttered. Fear slowed their hands. The path she seared was one they could not touch. A gap widened, filled with silence sharper than wind.

She stopped. The ember flared within her ribs, urging her upward, yet she held against it. Waiting cost warmth, cost time. Frost gnawed at the pause. Their faces, pale and stricken, hovered below. None dared draw closer. Unity cracked. She had to wait, her breath turning flame to smoke, the mountain above unmoving.

Minutes stretched thin. Delay lodged itself like ice in their bones. Progress dulled, urgency bled away. She saw the gulf not of stone but of will, and in that gulf time was lost.
```

**Scene 2.1.0.0:**

```
The chamber shuddered. Dust cascaded from rafters of steel, stirred by gears that should have stayed dead. Groans rolled through the walls, deep as if a buried titan stretched in its sleep. Each sound was a crack of prophecy made flesh.

The ember within her flared, answering. Its rhythm matched the tremor. A pulse against a pulse. She understood then that it was not a gift to deliver, not a burden to set down. It was a key. She was the lock. Her ribs closed around the ember as if they had always been fashioned for this fit.

The companions stumbled back, eyes wide, prayers tumbling from their lips. Fear turned them small, voices thin and ragged. Only she did not retreat. She felt the recognition travel through marrow and flame alike. The machine knew her. Its call was not a request but a claim. In that revelation, her path narrowed to a single line of fire, and there was no turning aside.
```

**Scene 2.1.0.1:**

```
Heat filled her veins until blood no longer seemed her own. The marrow inside her bones liquefied, glowing like metal under forge. She cried out, but her voice fractured, syllables dissolving into a flame-laden breath that licked the air. The sound was not human. It was fire speaking.

Her companions staggered back. They no longer saw Ilya in the figure before them. They saw a body thinned to light, skin dissolving into ember, hair scattering sparks with every movement. Her chest rose, and the ember pulsed as though her ribs were glass around its glow.

She did not resist. She recognized the change as claim, as prophecy breaking bone. The ember was not hers to carry anymore. She was becoming it. The machine’s hum deepened, a resonance that bent toward her body. In their eyes, her humanity burned away, and in its place rose a flame clothed in her form, ascendant, undeniable.
```

**Scene 2.1.0.2:**

```
The ember flared as though it had waited for this moment. Power coursed through her, jagged, sharp, unbidden. She drew in a breath and her ribs expanded with fire, not air. When she stepped forward, the sound of her footfall struck metal, ringing across the chamber like a hammer blow.

She rose taller, unbroken, stride gathering weight she had never possessed. Her voice, when it came, was not cry or whisper but a strike—metal against metal, clear and undeniable. It cut through the murmurs of her companions and froze their fear into silence. Before them stood not the woman who had carried the ember, but its living shape, drawn in flesh and flame.

The machine bent closer, groan shifting into bow. Its gears adjusted as though acknowledging her. Recognition hummed in the walls, answering her pulse. The ember had gained her utterly, and through her the chamber filled with a resonance too vast to refuse.
```

**Scene 2.1.1.0:**

```
The machine’s eye tore open, a slit of molten glare. A beam struck the ground before her, splitting stone with a hiss of heat. Shards flew outward. The path shattered at her feet, fissures glowing like wounds.

Her shield-bearer moved before thought, lifting his arms to block. The beam caught him whole. His body arched, then crumpled under force, smoke twisting upward from what had been flesh. He fell without cry, ash rising bitter in the chamber’s breath.

The fellowship thinned again. Silence pooled, thick and cold. She felt the ember pound in her chest, heavier than ever, its weight doubled by absence. The gift had demanded another body, another friend burned to keep its fire alive.
```

**Scene 2.1.1.1:**

```
Smoke clung to the broken floor, rising in slow curtains that stung the eyes and made breath raw. The chamber reeked of scorched flesh and stone. Each cough hollowed the silence further, until no sound remained but the ember’s throb within her ribs and the groan of the machine above.

She tried to move forward, but the air pushed her back, heat rolling like a tide from the wound it had made in the stone. Fire breathed against her skin, keeping her locked in place. Companions shifted at the edges of smoke, unable to advance, unwilling to abandon. All stood waiting, frozen in the pause the beam had carved into time.

Seconds grew longer, stretched taut and heavy. Pursuit far below would not reach them yet, but ascent was stalled. The ember pressed harder for motion, and still she waited, caught in the chamber’s choke, every heartbeat costing more than distance.
```

**Scene 2.1.1.2:**

```
The silence after the strike clung, heavy and sharp as ice. She thought it punishment, the machine’s wrath unleashed, but the truth slid into her like a blade of light: this was no rage. It was measure. Each fall, each ash-scattered body, marked the toll required. The machine did not kill blindly. It demanded loss.

Her chest tightened with the knowledge. The dead companion was not accident but price. His end was a seal upon the path, his ruin a step she now must climb across. The ember pulsed at her sternum as though agreeing, as though every consumed life was another key turned toward the lock.

She understood then that loss was passage. To ascend was to surrender piece after piece, until nothing left remained but flame itself. Cruel, precise, the revelation left no refuge. What had been grief became instruction, and she bore it forward.
```

**Scene 2.1.2.0:**

```
The resonance grew unbearable. Chains strung across the machine glowed, then drooped, molten lines dripping like wax. Their shriek filled the chamber, a sound of bonds failing. The air burned with release. She staggered, though her legs no longer felt her own.

Her arms blazed open, flesh thinned until bones shone, then cracked into radiant splinters. Fingers burst into shards of light, each fracture sparking pain that made her cry out. The ember surged in unison, forcing marrow to fuse with flame. She was no longer vessel. She was bridge.

She felt the pull of two forces—her body torn between human shape and the machine’s demand. Each breath was both scream and chime. The pain was absolute, but through it clarity arrived: the ember was never to be borne. It was to span the rift between husk and god, and she, undone, was its living bridge.
```

**Scene 2.1.2.1:**

```
The rupture did not end her. Instead, something surged back. What had been torn open now filled, veins brimming with a force that felt more solid than blood. Fire ran like sinew, like steel threading her frame. Her arms no longer crumbled; they rebuilt, lines of ember holding her upright.

She rose. Taller, broader, her breath shook the air as if a furnace had been set beneath her ribs. Companions stumbled in awe and fear. Before them stood not the weakened bearer, but a figure lit from within, power coursing in channels too bright for human form. The ember had not only consumed—it had given.

Her body thrummed, every gesture a strike against silence. She felt herself heavier, yet unbroken. What she bore was more than survival. It was strength, exceeding death’s demand, undeniable, a gain wrested from pain itself.
```

**Scene 2.1.2.2:**

```
When her body split into light, the chamber bent with it. Companions shrank from the brilliance, eyes covered, faces drawn back in fear. Some turned and fled into shadow, abandoning her to the fire that no longer wore a human frame. Their footsteps retreated quickly, swallowed by dark.

She called after them, but her voice came out broken, words collapsing into ash mid-air. No meaning carried. Nothing bridged the gulf between her flame and their bodies of flesh. Bonds that had endured hunger and cold now snapped under the heat, brittle and final.

In the silence that followed, the ember claimed her wholly. Fellowship dissolved, her path narrowed to a single figure cut against ruin. Alone, she bore the burden, and the cost of fire was plain: each step upward left only fewer beside her, until there were none.
```

**Scene 2.2.0.0:**

```
The path broke clean away, leaving only jagged stone and a gulf below. Dust still hung in the air, catching the ember’s glow, sinking into lungs until each breath burned raw. They coughed, eyes red, their feet refusing the edge. The fall was too wide. The leap promised only loss.

She measured the void again and again, but no angle closed the gap. Every glance across found nothing to meet her. Companions stood behind her, silence stretching until seconds grew heavy, thick as frost, weighing on their ribs. The ember pulsed impatiently, pressing for forward, but stone denied them.

Each pause turned marrow colder. The ground offered no purchase. Time itself felt wasted, spilling away in small, freezing increments. They waited, trapped, unable to advance, the way ahead sealed by rubble, the air itself conspiring to choke them as they stood still.
```

**Scene 2.2.0.1:**

```
She traced the gap again, but this time her eyes narrowed on the broken stone. The fractures curved too cleanly. Each edge carried marks not of collapse but of carving, the work deliberate, not ruin’s accident. Dust concealed it until now, and as it thinned she saw the lines: shallow grooves cut like script.

The void itself was a page. Across the gulf, the opposing wall bore the same inscriptions, runes burned into rock by a hand not human. The air chilled further as she read them, symbols shaped in the tongue of the gods. What she had thought impasse was design.

The truth struck. The bridge was never meant of stone. Passage demanded offering, not footing. The gap itself was hunger, a hollow opened to be fed with loss. She stood still, marrow tight, knowing the way forward was not to cross but to give, the demand carved plain before her.
```

**Scene 2.2.0.2:**

```
The silence stretched, their breath crystallizing between broken stone. She stared at the void again, yet the frost creeping along its edges shifted under her gaze. It no longer seemed dead matter. The ice breathed, groaned faintly, as if waiting. Her own lungs seized, frostbite biting deeper, and still the ember pulsed, twisting the cold into movement.

Her exhale rose like smoke, then hardened, becoming rope, then plank, then span. Each breath layered substance, each shiver shaping bridge from frost. Pain knifed through her limbs as marrow froze, but even that agony transfigured. Flame bound itself into ice, fire welding fracture. Her body shook with both burn and freeze until she no longer knew which was hers.

She understood: she had become the crossing. Cold and flame braided through her, woven into a single thread that stretched across the chasm. Companions saw the shape form, terrible and living, and knew she was no longer merely bearer of fire, but the bridge carved from flesh, frost, and ember together.
```

**Scene 2.2.1.0:**

```
The ember pulsed differently now. Not just burn, not just weight, but a throb that steadied her stance. It pushed outward, ribs glowing as if marrow itself had caught flame. Pain cracked her bones like ice under weight, yet in that shatter came new force, raw and searing, turned into fuel.

The glow spread to her companions. They lifted their heads, shoulders straightening as warmth clawed its way back into their blood. Their eyes glimmered with the same fire that coursed in her veins. Steps once faltering pressed forward again, their breaths ragged but stronger, each inhalation carrying a sting of ember.

She knew then the ember was testing her. It gave, but not freely. Power lent was leash as much as gift, demanding return with interest. Still, for a moment, they moved as if reprieved, a band no longer collapsing, but remade by fire’s brief and brutal generosity.
```

**Scene 2.2.1.1:**

```
The ember lent its fire, steadied their breath, and yet one fell. His knees buckled mid-step, body folding as if the gift had never touched him. Frost gathered quick around his mouth. His chest rose once, shallow, then not again. The flame’s nearness did nothing. The cold had already claimed him.

They circled briefly, but no hand could wake him. Eyes dulled to glass, fixed on nothing. The ember burned bright in Ilya’s grasp, but its reach could not cross that distance. She called his name once, but silence answered. They left him behind, a figure stiffening as frost poured over him.

When they walked on, their number was less. Warmth carried them forward, but the absence gnawed louder than the gift. Fire could lend step, but it could not restore what was gone. Every pace forward sounded thinner, a march hollowed by one less breath beside them.
```

**Scene 2.2.1.2:**

```
The fire that had steadied them faltered. Its warmth, a heartbeat before pulsing strong, thinned as if caught in its own hesitation. Breath that had been eased tightened again. They staggered, rhythm breaking, steps falling uneven. The ember’s glow dulled, not extinguished, but stalled, a withheld gift.

She felt the drag deep in her bones, the ember’s weight pressing heavier, not from burden alone but from delay. Every second stretched longer, each pause refusing release. Their progress slowed until the climb itself seemed shackled. Companions gasped, feet slipping on stone, their strength ebbing back into silence.

Forward became a crawl of seconds, each one stolen, each one dragging marrow colder. She clenched the ember, urging it on, but it refused, holding its fire in cruel suspense. The journey halted not by walls or void, but by the rhythm of a gift gone still.
```

**Scene 2.2.2.0:**

```
The hum rose beneath her palms, not quake but voice. Stone carried it, steady, insistent, pushing through her bones until every rib echoed. Frost thinned, revealing patterns beneath, grooves that curved and crossed into letters older than any tongue she knew but that her marrow recognized instantly. The ground was not mute. It was inscribed.

Companions shifted uneasily, hearing it too, though they lacked the sight. The frost retreated in veins of clarity, script cutting across the broken path. She bent low and traced the lines, the ember in her grip answering with a harder glow. The words formed plain: not chance, not metaphor, but command.

“One bearer, one fire—others must fade.” She read it aloud, voice brittle as ice. Silence followed, sharper than cold. Companions looked at her with dread that was no longer only fear of the journey but fear of her. The path had spoken, and its decree was merciless.
```

**Scene 2.2.2.1:**

```
The ground’s hum deepened until the ember flared in her grip, and light struck back at the carved stone. Flame crawled from her hand to her wrist, then to her arm, etching lines where no blade had cut. Flesh smoked. She gasped but did not drop it. The ember was not only carried now—it was writing her.

Script burned into her skin, searing each letter until it gleamed in red firelight. She tried to wrench free, but the ember tethered itself deeper, binding marrow to glyph. The pain was absolute, a furnace pressed against bone, yet beneath it lay clarity: she was being made vessel. The bearer not by choice but by incision.

Her companions stumbled away. One raised a hand as if to help, then froze, fear bright in his eyes. She stood altered, branded, and every breath from then on carried the weight of inscription. She was marked not as woman alone, but as the ember’s chosen page, flesh the scripture, path unchangeable.
```

**Scene 2.2.2.2:**

```
The stone’s command grew louder until it claimed more than words. One of them stumbled, knees striking rock, breath tearing once before ceasing. No blow, no wound—only silence clamping down as though the decree itself had taken its tithe. His body stiffened in moments, frost knitting over him like a lid.

The inscription glowed faint, as if fed, not by fire but by loss. She tried to reach, to lift him, but the ember held her hand back, its heat surging, its warning absolute. The flame was spared. His life was not. The cost had been set by something deeper than mercy: stone trading warmth for blood.

They moved on, one fewer again. No words filled the space he left. Only the scrape of boots against frozen path, the ember’s pulse harsher now, the silence widened to swallow them. The command had spoken, and it had collected its due.
```

**Scene 0.0.0.0:**

```
The ember consumed her. It did not wait for consent but drew her marrow out in flame, pulling every nerve taut until body itself gave way. Yet as she burned, the sky shifted. Clouds long frozen split at their seams, spilling a light that was neither memory nor false dawn but the first edge of renewal. The horizon cracked open.

Her flesh was gone in that rising. Ash fell, silent, weightless, carried wide across the plain. Companions who still lived turned their faces upward, blinded, warmed, broken but no longer in darkness. The ember’s theft, the long flight, the blood debt—it ended not in hoarding but in release. Light returned, and with it the cruel gift of cost.

Where she had stood there was no body, only scatter. Fire had made its claim, and the cycle had closed with her dissolution. Dawn came ash-born, unpromised yet undeniable, the world dimly gaining what she alone could not keep.
